# About this website

Many years ago, my mom took it upon herself to sketch out our family tree on a huge piece of paper. After she finished drawing in all the known data, she shared it with us. I took one look and thought, “I‘ll bet there‘s computer software that makes it much easier to keep track of all of this.”

Within a week, I'd settled on Reunion from Leister Productions, and a week after that I'd duplicated mom's work in the computer. It was so easy, I started seeking out more source material.

Then I bought a copy of "BLICKENSDERFER / BLICKENSTAFF / BLICK / PLEAK FAMILIES, DESCENDANTS OF HANS JAKOB BLICKENSDOERFER (c. 1690 to 1735-1738)," compiled by Maxine L. (Runkle) Blickenstaff, Mary F. Mickey, and Mary M. (Meyers) Williams, and this project really shifted into high gear.
