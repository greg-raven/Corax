			<p>
				The earliest known authentic information of the Blickensderfer family in America is contained in the land titles in the government archives of the city of Speyer, the capital of the Palatinate or Rheinish province of the kingdom of Bavaria, in Germany. These records state that on August 20, 1711, the Elector John William sold and conveyed a certain &quot;Kohlacher Estate on the Rehehuette,&quot; situated in the Schifferstadt sub-division of the Electorate of Speyer, containing about 60 morgen (morgen - 1 1/8 acres) of grain land and 6 morgen of meadow, to a certain John Hey, his wife and heirs, in consideration of 150 florins paid in hand, and of a rental of 29 malter (malter = 19 bushels) of rye and 10 malter of oats to be paid annually on St. Martin's Day (11th November).
			</p>
			<p>
				April 27, 1713, this estate was transferred to a certain Ulrich Schneider, who, on February 12, 1716, received permission of the Electoral Palatinate Court to convey the same to the &quot;Anabaptist&quot; Blickensderfer, or Pleickensdoerffer, as the name is there written.
			</p>
			<p>
				This estate has ever since remained in the possession of descendants of the &quot;Anabaptist&quot;, and is now [Editor's note: 1897.] owned and occupied by members of the family.
			</p>
			<p>
				The given name of the &quot;Anabaptist&quot; unfortunately does not appear in the records, nor is there any further account of his ancestry. Tradition says the Blickensderfers originally came from Switzerland, being disciples of Menuo Simons [Editor's note: Menno Simons], and were expelled from that country on account of their religious tenets. There is an old place in Switzerland, near the city of Zug, called Blickensdorf, but it is now only a small hamlet. However, the fact of the existence of this old dorf of this name and the fact that many Blickensderfers still reside in this vicinity lends credence to the tradition.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				1. Anabaptist Blickensderfer. Of the Anabaptist himself little is known except what appears in the Speyer archives, and of his family it is only known that he had six sons, of whom five emigrated to America and one remained on the Kohlacher estate, in Germany; but who was his wife, and whether there were other children is unknown; nor is there any record of his birth or death. If we assume he was at least twenty-four years old when he purchased the Kohlacher estate from Schneider, in 1716, it follows that he was born not later than 1692, and it is probable his birth was a few years prior to that date. While there is no record of his death, certain known facts seem to show that he died in 1767, and that at his death he conveyed the Kohlacher estate to the widow of his son, in trust for his grandson, John George; the son, apparently, having died in 1761-62, before the death of the Anabaptist. The six sons were:
			</p>
			<p>
				2. I - Christian, born March 6, 1724, died April 8, 1800.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. II - John, born, date not known; died, date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. III - ____, born, date not known; died, date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. IV - Jacob, born, date not known; died, date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. V - Ulrich, born, date not known; died, date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				7. VI - Jost, born February 2, 1735; died, July 13, 1826.
			</p>
			<p>
				The order of the birth of these sons is not known further than that Jost is known to have been the youngest and Christian was probably the oldest.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides the Anabaptist and his descendants, there is a family of Blickensdoerfers residing in the vicinity of Schmitterhof, Germany, of whom one named John, born October 22, 1815, was yet living in 1893, and also a nephew of his; but all they knew or could tell of their ancestors was that John's father was named Jacob, and his grandfather, John; but when either was born they knew not. Nor did they know whence their family came nor when it first appeared about Schmitterhof.
			</p>
			<p>
				In attempting to trace this family back, we cannot place the birth of the father, Jacob, earlier than about 1780-1790, nor that of the grandfather, John, prior to about 1750-1760. This would make this oldest ancestor, John, contemporary with the Anabaptist's grandson, born in 1754. But George was an only child and his descendants are all known and it is generally conceded that the Anabaptist had but six sons, one of whom was the father of George, and the other five emigrated to America, and with their descendants remained there. From this it would follow that if the Blickensdoerfers at Schmitterhof have the same origin with those at the Kohlhof and in America, the connecting link between them must lie at least as far back as the Anabaptist or his ancestors; that is, prior to 1700. They may be descendants of a brother, or some other relative of the Anabaptist, but are not his descendants. If the tradition that the Blickensdoerfers were expelled from Switzerland be true, it is not improbable those at Schmitterhof are descendants of a different branch of the same family, from whom the one who purchased the Kohlhof in 1716 is descended, and may have settled at Schmitterhof about the same time as the latter settled at the Kohlhof.
			</p>
			<p>
				John, born October 22, 1815, had two brothers, Michael and Peter, both younger than himself. Michael married Cath. Geiger. They had three sons, Peter, Paul and William, all living in 1893. Peter married Philippena Lohring. They have one son, John and two daughters, Barbara and Marie. John has no children.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are also other Blickensdoerfers in Europe, but there is no known connection between them and those at Kohlhof or Schmitterhof, although it is not improbable that all are descendants from a common ancestor in Switzerland.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Christian 2 &quot; Blickensderfer
			</p>
			<p>
				Christian was born March 6, 1724, at the Kohlhof, in the Palatinate. Married, January 7, 1748, Catharine Shurger, the daughter of a Mennonite preacher, at Eisenbach, Zweibruecken, where she was born October 14, 1727. After his marriage he moved to Neider Saulheim, where he resided several years. In 1753, he, with his family, emigrated to America, accompanied by his youngest brother, Yost, then a lad of eighteen years of age, landing at Philadelphia September 29 of that year, from the ship Rowand, Arthur Trau master, from Rotterdam, via Cowes. Both Christian and Yost signed the declaration of allegiance to the king of England, at the time required of all immigrants into Pennsylvania, and which is preserved in the Colonial records at Harrisburgh.
			</p>
			<p>
				After remaining about a year and a half in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Christian removed to Lancaster county and settled on a farm near Lititz, where he resided until the spring of 1761, when he built a house in Lititz and became a resident of that town, remaining there until his death. He was a farmer, with but little patrimony, most of which was expended in reaching America, but earned his support largely by teaming, an occupation very common in early times, before the construction of canals and railways; and from the exposure incident to which, he in later years became an invalid. But being of industrious and frugal habits, he accumulated a moderate property, sufficient to support him comfortably when he was no longer able to work.
			</p>
			<p>
				January 27, 1778, Christian's wife died. She was a woman of more than ordinary strength of mind and ability, exercising great influence in the forming of a substantial and solid character in her children, all of whom became persons of influence in the communities in which they dwelt. She was a sincere and active Christian, the family connecting themselves with the Moravian church immediately after their arrival in America, first at Philadelphia, and subsequently at Lititz, where she is buried.
			</p>
			<p>
				November 16, 1779, Christian married again, his second wife being the widow Barbara Mueller, maiden name Leithold, born August 8, 1740. They had no children. He died April 8, 1800, and is buried at Lititz. His second wife died ___, and is buried at Lititz.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their children were:
			</p>
			<p>
				I - John Andrew, born April 17, 1750, in Germany; came to America with his parents in 1753; died unmarried January 10, 1775, at Lititz, and is buried there.
			</p>
			<p>
				8. II - Jacob, born February 13, 1752, in Germany; died January 20, 1778.
			</p>
			<p>
				9. III - Christian, born October 6, 1753; died March 8, 1820.
			</p>
			<p>
				10. IV - Catharine, born May 17, 1761; died August 20, 1823.
			</p>
			<p>
				11. V - Matthias, born April 30, 1764; died April 23, 1809.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides these, he had four other children, all of whom died in infancy or childhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. John 2 &quot; Blickensderfer
			</p>
			<p>
				John was born in Germany, no doubt on the Kohlhof, but the date of his birth is not known. He is supposed to have been one of the older brothers, and the date of his birth is probably somewhere between 1724 and 1730. In 1749 he emigrated to America, accompanied by his younger brother, Ulrich, landing in Philadelphia September 9, 1749, from the ship St. Andrew, James Abercrombie master, from Rotterdam via Plymouth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where John first settled is unknown, but he probably remained some time in Eastern Pennsylvania and Maryland, then containing large numbers of settlers from the Palatinate, some of whom he may have known in Europe. Lancaster and York counties, in Pennsylvania, and Frederick county in Maryland, were largely settled by immigrants from that part of Germany.
			</p>
			<p>
				John finally drifted to Western North Carolina, and the first authentic information of him in America is contained in a letter (a copy of which is still in existence [ ...ed note: 1899 _]) addressed to his sister-in-law, Eva, at the Kohlhof, dated from Meadow Creek, Virginia, 1774. In this letter he states that his wife had died three years previously, after having been a helpless invalid for three years from acute rheumatism; but that he and his two children were in good health. In this letter he acknowledges the receipt of 90 gulden sent him through his brother, Christian, and requests the remittance of the balance that may be coming to him from the paternal estate, as he needs it to secure him from the loss of his land.
			</p>
			<p>
				The precise location of this Meadow Creek, where John dates his letter, is not known. In 1776, during the Revolutionary war, his brother, Yost, then residing in Frederick county Maryland, visited him. Yost's descendants say their forefather stated John's residence was on or near the Holston river, in South Carolina, describing the immense flocks of wild geese which congregated on the Holston. This is evidently an error, so far as South Carolina is concerned, as neither the Holston nor any of its affluents is in that state. The place is probably in what was then claimed as Western North Carolina. It is a well known historical fact that during Colonial times there was much dispute in regard to the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina, both colonies claiming jurisdiction over portions of that very territory drained by the Holston river; and when subsequently the boundaries were adjusted some persons found themselves located in one state when they had supposed they were residents of the other: and this may have been the case with John Blickensderfer. Kentucky was organized out of what was claimed Western Virginia, and Tennessee out of Western North Carolina. John's location was probably on an affluent of the Holston in what is now Washington County, Tennessee, but it cannot be satisfactorily identified.
			</p>
			<p>
				On his return to Maryland, Yost is reported as saying John had but one son living in 1776, named John, and there is no further account of either father or son, except that &quot;it is said&quot; the son finally went West.
			</p>
			<p>
				John's children were:
			</p>
			<p>
				I - John, born date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				II - A son, born date not know.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Jacob 2 Blickensderfer [Ed Note: some researchers indicate this son and the accompanying story is apocraphyal. Further research is needed.]
			</p>
			<p>
				Very little is known of Jacob. Presumably he was born at the Kohlhof, in the Palatinate, nearly midway between Mannheim and Speyer, where all the rest of the family had their birth. The time of his birth is also unknown, but it is known that Yost was the youngest, and Christian probably the oldest or next to the oldest. The date of Yost's birth being February 2, 1735, and Christian's March 6, 1724, and assuming Ulrich to have been next to Yost, as is generally believed and that Jacob was next to Ulrich, his birth probably was about 1728-1730. He was the first to emigrate to America, landing in Philadelphia September 16, 1748, from the ship Paliene, John Brown master, from Rotterdam, via Cowes. He came with a numerous company from the Palatinate, but unaccompanied by any other member of the Blickensderfer family. There is nothing known of his having permanently settled anywhere, and nothing is known of his descendants, if he had any. Tradition says that soon after his arrival in America he went West and lived among the Indians, nothing being heard from him for many years, when he suddenly appeared among his brothers in Eastern Pennsylvania, dressed in full Indian costume, hunting shirt and breech cloth, so transformed in appearance that none of them would acknowledge him to be their brother. He continued with them some time, vainly trying to convince them of his identity, until one day, in the course of conversation, he all at once asked one of them: &quot;Don't you remember the drubbing we once gave our older brother behind the barn, in Germany, because of his disposition to domineer over us?&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				This reference to an incident of their early life finally convinced them that he really was their brother.
			</p>
			<p>
				But he did not long remain in Eastern Pennsylvania. He hankered after the freedom of forest life, again went West among the Indians and was never more heard from. How and when his life terminated is unknown.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Ulrich 2 Blickensderfer
			</p>
			<p>
				Ulrich was born in the Palatinate, presumably at the Kohlhof, some time between 1724 and 1735. He is generally conceded to have been next youngest to Yost, which would fix the time of his birth about 1731-33. He came to America with his older brother, John, landing at Philadelphia September 9, 1749, from the ship St. Andrew, James Abercrombie master, from Rotterdam, via Plymouth. He signed the declaration of allegiance then required of all immigrants landing in Pennsylvania, and preserved in the Colonial records at Harrisburgh. His autograph is &quot;Ulrich Blickestorfer.&quot; These two brothers came to America about one year after Jacob, and four years before the arrival of Christian and Yost.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where Ulrich first settled in America is not certain, but he is known to have been in Lancaster and also in York county, Pennsylvania, and in Frederick county Maryland, where he probably married and first resided. But before the Pontiac war (1763) he had definitely located somewhere in Morrison's Cove, Bedford county, Pennsylvania. From this place he was several times driven by the savages, once with the loss of his oldest son, killed by the Indians. During the Indian disturbances, he remained some time with his relatives in Maryland, but subsequently returned to Bedford county, where as far as it is known he continued to reside for the remainder of his life. The date and place of his death are not known, but he must have attained a ripe age, because his nephew, Matthias [ ...#11 _], in a letter (still extant) dated August, 1806, to his cousin in Germany, speaks of his uncle Ulrich, evidently then living, as a member of the Dunkard Society, and describes him as &quot;quite a small may with an extraordinarily large beard, grown to his eyes, and with but one eye, all of which gives him a very striking appearance.&quot; In 1806 Ulrich must have been considerably over 76 years old. It is not known who was his wife, nor where or when she was born, or when she died.
			</p>
			<p>
				His children, as far as known, were:
			</p>
			<p>
				I - Jacob, born, date not known. He was killed by the Indians in Bedford county, Pennsylvania.
			</p>
			<p>
				13. II - John, born, date not known. He married and resided in Montgomery county, Ohio, and died there.
			</p>
			<p>
				III - David, born, date not known. He married Juliana Shirts, in _______.
			</p>
			<p>
				Frederick county, Maryland; was a carpenter by trade.
			</p>
			<p>
				IV - Peter, born, date not known. It is said he lived near Niagara Falls.
			</p>
			<p>
				14. V - Abraham, born, date not known; resided in 1812 near Salem, Jefferson county, Ohio; is said to have served in the war of 1812 as a substitute, and to have died in Kentucky.
			</p>
			<p>
				15. VI - Joseph, born about 1780, married, resided and died in Montgomery county, Ohio.
			</p>
			<p>
				VII - Susan, born date not known. She married a man named Peacock, who resided near Moorefield, Harrison county, Ohio.
			</p>
			<p>
				VIII- A daughter, born date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				IX - A daughter, born date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				7. Jost 2 Blickensderfer
			</p>
			<p>
				Jost - or Yost, as the English write the name - was the youngest son of the Anabaptist, born at the Kohlhof, in the Palatinate, February 2, 1735. He came to America in company with his brother, Christian, landing in Philadelphia September 29, 1753, from the ship Rowand, Arthur Trau master, from Rotterdam, via Cowes. Both brothers signed the usual declaration of allegiance to the king of England then required of all immigrants to Pennsylvania, the originals of which are preserved in the colonial records at Harrisburgh. Yost's autograph is &quot;Jost Blickensdorffer.&quot; Tradition says Yost would not consent to accompany his brother to America until he was promised a rifle. This, considering he was then a lad of 18 years of age, is not improbable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of Yost's first years in America little is known. He probably spent much of him time with Christian, who first settled near Philadelphia, but subsequently removed to the vicinity of Lititz, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. At a later date Yost seems to have spent some time in York county, but finally drifted to Frederick county, Maryland, acquiring land and making his home near where Wolfville is located.
			</p>
			<p>
				About the year 1766 or 1767 Yost married Elizabeth Ochs, but it is not known when nor where she was born. In 1776, during the war of the revolution, Yost visited his brother, John, residing on or near the Holston river, somewhere in Western North Carolina, and spent some time with him; but subsequently returned to Maryland. His first wife died about 1780-89, the date unknown, and he remained a widower until some time in 1797, when he married again. His second wife was Margaret Fuller, who was born in 1778 and died February 18, 1830. He continued to reside on his farm in Maryland for the remainder of his life and died July 13, 1826, aged over 91 years. He lies buried in a private graveyard on his old farm near Wolfsville.
			</p>
			<p>
				His children were:
			</p>
			<p>
				By his first wife:
			</p>
			<p>
				I - Adam, born date unknown; died young, about 1773.
			</p>
			<p>
				16. II - Joseph, born June 19, 1768; died September 20, 1841.
			</p>
			<p>
				II - A daughter, born, date not known, died young
			</p>
			<p>
				17. IV - Elizabeth, born date not known; died June 6, 1829.
			</p>
			<p>
				18. V - Jacob, born September 21, 1775; died August 6, 1852.
			</p>
			<p>
				19. VI - Catharine, born ___; died March 19, 1838.
			</p>
			<p>
				20. VII - Christian born November 16, 1780; died December 1, 1865.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides these there was another daughter that died young.
			</p>
			<p>
				By his second wife:
			</p>
			<p>
				21. VIII - Daniel, born June 4, 1880; died August 11, 1843.
			</p>
			<p>
				IX - William, born November 22, 1801; died January 30, 1848.
			</p>
			<p>
				He was unmarried.
			</p>
			<p>
				22. X - John, born December 9, 1803; died January 7, 1884.
			</p>
			<p>
				XI - A daughter, born date not known; died young.
			</p>
			<p>
				XII - Another child; born, date not known; died in infancy.
			</p>
			<p>
				23. XIII - Margaret, born June 4, 1811; died January 26, 1888.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yost and his descendants departed from the original orthography in writing their name, changing it to the more anglicised form of Blickenstaff, which is uniformly adopted by them.
			</p>
			<p>
				8. Jacob 3 Blickensderfer (Christian 2)
			</p>
			<p>
				Jacob was born February 13, 1752, in the Palatinate, and was brought to America by his parents in 1753, and to Lititz, Pennsylvania in 1761. He remained with his parents until about fourteen years old, when he was sent to York county, remaining there until 1777. At York he married a woman named Ilgenfritz, and attached himself to the Lutheran church, but in 1777 removed to a farm near Lititz. Here he died, January 20, 1778, of camp fever, contracted while furnishing supplies to the hospital of Revolutionary solders at Lititz, where he lies buried. His children were:
			</p>
			<p>
				24. I - Catharine, born November 4, 1775; died October 23, 1866.
			</p>
			<p>
				II - Elisabeth, born, date not known; died, date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				After her father's death, she accompanied her mother to the &quot;Glades,&quot; in Somerset county, Pennsylvania, and her history is lost.
			</p>
			<p>
				9. Christian 3 Blickensderfer (Christian 2)
			</p>
			<p>
				Christian was born in the city of Philadelphia, October 6, 1753, just one week after his parents landed in America. He married Barbara Born, who was born July 1, 1760, and resided on a farm near Lititz until the spring of 1812, when he removed with his entire family, his brother-in-law, Casper Henry Van Lehn, and several of this nephews to Tuscarawas county, Ohio, where he had previously purchased nearly twelve hundred acres of land. Here he lived the remainder of his life. He died March 8, 1820, and lies buried at Sharon, Tuscarawas county, Ohio. His wife died April 11, 1823, and is also buried at Sharon. His children were:
			</p>
			<p>
				25. I - John, born November 7, 1782; died May 28, 1848.
			</p>
			<p>
				26. II - Christian, born December 7, 1787; died April 5, 1854.

			</p>
			<p>
				IV - George, born April 19, 1792, died August 3, 1823.
			</p>
			<p>
				George was born at Lititz, and in 1810 went to Tuscarawas county, Ohio, where in 1811 he married Susan Pickel, who appears to have been a sister to Martin Keller's wife. He was a farmer and resided about a mile north of the village of Tuscarawas. His children were one son and four daughters:
			</p>
			<p>
				Sarah, born June 13, 1813, and married David Reichman October 18, 1832.

			</p>
			<p>
				Catharine was born May 17, 1761 at Lititz, Pennsylvania. October 6, 1782, she married Matthias Muecke,of Christiansbrunn, Northampton county..until about 1792, when they removed to the vicinity of Lititz and lived there the remainder of their lives.

William followed his brothers to Ohio at an early date, was never married, and resided among them, but engaged in the navigation of flatboats, or &quot;broadhorns&quot;, as they were termed on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, then one of the principal methods of transporting the products of the west to a market. These boats were built on the upper waters of the Ohio and its affluents, laden with flour and other products, and in the spring of the year, when the streams were in flood, floated to New Orleans, where both lading and boat were sold. The navigators then worked their way back during the summer, prepared for another voyage the succeeding spring.

				On one of these trips, William and his cousin, Joseph Blickensderfer [ ...ed. note: son of # 16 _], found themselves at the Falls of the Ohio (now Louisville), in straitened circumstances, and both there enlisted in the United States regular army for five years. This was in June 1825. William served in the Fifth Infantry, on the Western frontier, at Rock Island and Fort Snelling until 1829, when, having secured a substitute, he was discharged at St. Louis, and starting on his return to Ohio, proceeded as far as Shawneetown, Illinois, from when he wrote to his brother, Jacob, June 24, 1829, but was never afterward heard from.

He was the only child of his father, who, from the best obtainable information, seems to have died in 1761-62, five or six years before the death of his grandfather, the Anabaptist. The latter at his death appears to have bequeathed the Kohlhof estate to his son's widow, Eva, the mother of John George, in trust for the grandson. John George married Magdelina Neff. He was a member and a preacher of the Mennonite denomination, highly esteemed among his people, and at one time served a congregation of Mennonites at Neuwied; but resided nearly all his life at the Kohlhof, cultivating the estate.

				With the residents of the Palatinate generally, he suffered much from the devastations of the Napoleonic wars. His son, John, relates that more than once they were driven from the house by the enemies; shot and their house plundered, at one time so completely that nothing was left to subsist upon. He was at times obliged to cultivate his fields by moonlight and sow his seed by night or in heavy fogs to prevent its being taken from him, and in this manner secure a prospect of reaping something for bread for the ensuing year.

			<p>
				13. John 3 Blickensderfer (Ulrich 2 Anabaptist 1)
			</p>
			<p>
				Comparatively little is known of John. He was probably born at Morrison's Cove, Bedford County, Pennsylvania, but the date of his birth is not known. Ulrich's sons drifted in different directions, mostly Westward, and the first reliable information of John is that he and his brother, Joseph, settled in Montgomery County, Ohio, on Wolf's creek, about four miles west of Dayton, about the year 1806, or shortly before. Here John married a farmer's daughter, but nothing is known of her except that her name was Hannah, and the records of Montgomery county show a deed was made August 13, 1823, by Jacob Stutsmen and Elizabeth, his wife, and William Brombaugh and Eve, his wife, to Hanna Flickenstaffer for one hundred acres of land in section 20, township 2, range C east, Montgomery county.
			</p>
			<p>
				That this Hannah Flickenstaffer was John's widow is also known.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of Ulrich's descendants departed from the original orthography in writing their names, some writing Flickenstaff or Flickenstaffer, as above; some write simply Blick, one or two write Flicker, but the greater portion write Blickenstaff, as do the descendants of Yost.
			</p>
			<p>
				John died in Montgomery county about 1816, while yet a comparatively young man, but the exact date of his death is not known, nor is that of his wife. His children were: Emanual, born date not known; a daughter, born date not known.
			</p>
			<p>
				The history of these children is not known, but the records of Montgomery county show the marriage of Catherine Flickenstaff to Daniel Deeter, by Ralph Braddock, justice of the peace, January 19, 1830, and there is strong probability that this was John's daughter.
			</p>
			<p>
				14. Abraham 3 Blickensderfer (Ulrich 2 Anabaptist 1)
			</p>
			<p>
				According to most reliable accounts, Abraham was born in Frederick county, Maryland, but the date of his birth is unknown; nor is it known where he spent the earlier years of his life -- probably in Bedford county, Pennsylvania. He was a basket maker, and at various times travelled back and forth between Bedford county, Pennsylvania, and Frederick county, Maryland. It is said he served in the war of 1812 as substitute for another, name not known. In 1812, when his relations moved from Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, to Ohio, he resided near Annapolis, or Salem, Jefferson county, Ohio, and had a large family. Some of his children were, with his consent, taken by and reared in the families of these relatives in Tuscarawas county, Ohio. Later in life he removed to Kentucky, and probably died there, but there is no record of the time or place of his death. His children were:

			<p>
				15. Joseph 3 Blickensderfer (Ulrich 2 Anabaptist 1)
			</p>
			<p>
				Joseph was born in Morrison's Cove, Bedford county, Pennsylvania, about 1780, but the exact date of his birth is not known. He probably spent his earlier years at the paternal home, but afterward drifted Westward. About 1805 he, with his brother, John, removed to Montgomery county, Ohio, where, about 1808, he married Barbara Wolf, the daughter of Leonard Wolf, a well-to-do farmer who owned considerable land on Wolf's Creek, about four miles west of Dayton. It is said this was a runaway match, Joseph obtaining his wife against her father's consent. However this may be, he settled on a farm granted by Mr. Wolf to his daughter, where he resided until his death, in January, 1818, at about 38 years of age. This farm, containing 160 acres, the Montgomery county records show, was in 1819 conveyed by Leonard Wolf to Joseph's heirs, reserving a life interest in favor of the widow. Joseph was buried on the farm of Christian Shively, who married one of his daughters, about three miles west of Dayton, but there is no monument or other mark to designate his grave. In 1834 the widow and children sold their farm in Montgomery county and removed to Tippecanoe county, Indiana. There is no record of her death. Their children were:
