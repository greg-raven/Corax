					The Capital City Arts Initiative [CCAI] presents its exhibition, <a href="/persons/jennifer-jean-raven/cg/index.html"><em>Jenny Raven: The Creative Growth Years 1979&#8211;1984</em></a> with artwork by artist <a href="https://webcards.corax.org/wc02/wc02_065.html">Jenny Raven</a> in the city&rsquo;s Community Center Sierra Room, 851 E William Street, Carson City. The exhibition is available to the public from July 2&ndash;October 18, 2018. CCAI will host an exhibition reception on Friday, August 17, 5-7 p.m. in the Sierra Room.
				</p>

					CCAI is proud to show Jenny Raven&rsquo;s work &mdash; with thanks to Nancy Raven, her mother, who resides in Minden, Nevada. Raven&rsquo;s exhibition is a companion show to <em>Visual Oasis: Works from Creative Growth,</em> a survey of art in the CCAI Courthouse Gallery through September 27.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raven lived in San Diego, California, until the middle 70s. Following surgery for a brain tumor that left her disabled with limited short-term memory, her family moved to Berkeley, California. There she was able to access purpose and artistic guidance at Creative Growth Art Center. Raven worked in a variety of media, but she preferred drawing with pen and ink. Sadly, she died at 23 years of age, but during the last five years of her life, she thrived as an artist at CGAC developing a mature style in her art.
