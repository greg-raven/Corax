				Everett Richard Wilson
			</h2>
			<p>
				BONSALL &mdash; <a href="https://webcards.corax.org/ps02/ps02_191">Everett Richard Wilson</a> passed away Wednesday morning, January 5th, 2011, at age 83.
			</p>
			<p>
				Born in Glendale, California in 1928, Everett was a long-time rancher, raising avocados, citrus, and flowers on a 40-acre ranch in Bonsall, California. He spent his high school years in Vista, California, and was the son of Omar and Janice Wilson.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to serving in the Air Force for six years and rising to the rank of Lieutenant, Everett graduated from Long Beach State with degrees in Art and Graphic Design, and he went on to become an art teacher and wrestling and football coach for San Marcos High School.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everett parlayed his art background in many ways. After graduation, he and a friend founded a design company specializing in Danish modern furniture and accessories. He designed and built the home he and his wife and family grew up and lived in, and he dabbled in a variety of artistic endeavors including painting, pottery, welding, macram, silk-screening, and leatherwork. And on many occasions, he could be found with grandchildren, constructing an intricate structure from Legos, Tinker toys, and building blocks.
			</p>
			<p>
				He is also the designer and founder of Holly Filters, a filtration system for groves and yards that was utilized by many local farms and groves, and he served on the Board of Directors for Index Mutual and The California Avocado Commission.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everett was very athletic and enjoyed many sports, but his primary loves were golfing, surfing, and especially snow skiing. Everett was not only a member of the Big Bear ski patrol, but also a member of the ski team during his time in the Air Force, and he taught his children and grandchildren to ski. Everett was an avid sailor, winning the Racing Yachtsman of the Year and Skipper of the Year at the Oceanside Yacht Club, and founding the infamous <q>Beer Can Racing Series</q> that continued long after Everett retired from the yacht club. Fellow yacht club members sported T-shirts that Everett designed and silk-screened to commemorate the Around the Coronados races for many years. But perhaps his most ambitious sea-worthy project was designing and building his own sail boat after his existing boat was totaled in an accident during a race.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everett is survived by his beloved wife, Nancy; his children, Jefferson Chambers and Dobie Houson; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

				Memories and condolences

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Celebrating a life well lived. We will cherish the memories forever of such a great guy. Will never forget the fun times with the Easter egg hunts when we were kids, and also will never forget the fun avocado picking as adults. And, the super holiday feasts we would always have on the ranch! Had such fun and great memories as kids <q>camping out</q> in the old travel trailer on the ranch with my mom. ER was always there for a helping hand and making sure we all had a good time. You will be missed dearly, and will be in our thoughts and prayers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Dear Nancy, Jeff, Dobie and families &mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					I consider ER to be one of the early <q>pioneers</q> of our little neighborhood. (I still think of it as our little neighborhood, even though I moved away years ago.) I remember him as a strong, hard-working man who provided a comfortable and safe home for his family, in addition to being the father of one of my best friends. Some of my fondest childhood memories include time spent with the Wilson family. I have vivid memories of the annual Wilson barbeques that brought our entire neighborhood together and provided the perfect showcase for ER&rsquo;s skills at the pit barbeque. (Still some of the best barbeque ever!) I remember him as my ski partner on one last run after a long day at June Mountain; it makes me smile now when I think of his patience with my skiing.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a child, I remember being impressed with ER&rsquo;s artwork. From his beautiful Christmas cards to the countless handcrafted artistic touches both inside and outside your home, his unique style is something I still appreciate.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am glad to have known ER and for the memories of him that I hold dear. My heartfelt condolences to all of you; you are each in my thoughts and prayers. With love,
				</p>

					Dear Nancy,
				</p>
				<p>
					I&rsquo;m so sorry to learn of your husband&rsquo;s passing &hellip; such a vital person and active person all of his life.

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					A SPECIAL PERSON REMEMBERED: Dear Nancy, Jeff and Dobie; I will share some of my thoughts after hearing of Everett&rsquo;s life on earth ending. In this journey we are on it is a privilege to meet those given special gifts and hard-working individuals who are settled and constant. Everett (as well as each of you) had these qualities and it was our family&rsquo;s good fortune to be your neighbors. Throughout the years, I enjoyed watching the development and completion of the design of your home and ranch, and it was always a pleasure to be part of the fun social get-togethers at your home. In anything that ER was involved in, there was always such an expression of an artistic appreciation. Neighbors have come and gone, but it was our good fortune that your family remained settled so near ours and that we shared good times through the years. A Beautiful Life Honored. Your friend and neighbor,
				</p>

					Dear Nancy and Everett&rsquo;s loved ones.
				</p>

					We would love to add to all his accomplishments that Everett loved our mutual grandchildren Caden and Hailey.
				</p>
				<p>
					For that we are so thankful.

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Dearest Nancy, Jeff, Dobie and families; my memories with your family go back years and years &hellip; school days with Jeff and Dobie, baking biscuits with Dobie, Nancy as our 4-H leader in bread baking, and ER making the effort to get the neighbors together to celebrate the 4th of July with a fantastic BBQ. Lovely memories I&rsquo;ll treasure! Please know that you&rsquo;re all in my thoughts and prayers.

					Dear Nancy, Jeff, Dobie, and grandkids:
				</p>
				<p>
					So sorry to hear of the loss of your husband, father and grandpa. You will all miss him so much. I will always remember ER as a very talented and hardworking man with many interests. I appreciate his kindness to our family and have fond memories of the many years he and Nancy generously worked to create great 4th of July barbeques for the neighborhood.
