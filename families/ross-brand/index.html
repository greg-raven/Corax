				<b>STORM &mdash;</b> The Electrical fluid was on a frolic on Thursday night last. A violent thunder storm came up about 10 o&rsquo;clock in the evening and disturbed the peace and quiet of the town, to such an extent that everybody left the streets and took to their houses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Thomas Everete&rsquo;s house, in the North West part of town, was struck by lightning and set on fire. The fire was soon extinguished. &mdash; Mr. Elijah Morris&rsquo; house was struck at the same time, and set on fire. But for the early hour of the night, both would have burned down. &mdash; A window in Mr. Robert Singleton&rsquo;s house north of town, was knocked completely out, by another stroke of lightning. &mdash; The Eating House at the Depot, dept by John Hubbell, received its share of the lightning, which disturbed the dishes, tables, etc.; but the lightning was not strong enough to cut off the supplies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything was so very pleasant, and our friends so happy around us at the time, that we hardly noticed a storm was raging. So, may it ever be, when the storms of life are raging all around the, that they, who commenced their new lives in a storm of happiness, may be as we were, forgetful it&rsquo;s fury, fearless of its results, and happy in their own prosperity.

				<b>Wendell Phillips at the City Hall Tonight</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is seldom that cities of this size are favored with the opportunity of hearing so renowned an orator as Mr. Phillips. His lecture, &ldquo;Lost Arts,&rdquo; is said to be very fine, and those who wish to listen to a polished speaker, a scholar, and elocutions should not fail to hear Mr. Phillips.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Rev. David Warnock</b> occupied the pulpit at Grace Church Sunday morning last, and Rev. E. D. Whitlock, of the William Street Church, Delaware, in the evening. Both preached excellent and acceptable sermons, as they always do. Pastor Spahr was badly disabled during the week with an attack of lumbago. (Handwritten, Aug, 1879)

				<b>The last Sabbath</b> George Talbott, Secretary of Grace M.E. Sabbath school, rendered his report for the past year, which is spoken of as one of the best ever given. The report for which a vote of thanks was offered was substantially as follows: Scholars enrolled, 250; average attendance, 163; teachers enrolled, 23, average attendance 21 1/2; officers 5, average attendance 4 1/2; and an average of 33 visitors each Sabbath, making an average attendance of the school for the year of 221. Collections for the year $314.75; expenses, 286.94; balance on hand $27.81. There is an increase in the attendance of the school of 90, and in the collections of $130.00. We doubt if there is another school in the State than can show a more faithful set of officers and teachers than this school. (Handwritten: Jan 4<sup>th</sup> 1880)

				<b>The 18<sup>th</sup> Regulars at the Battle of Murfreesboro&rsquo;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Twenty companies of this splendid regiment participated in the above battle. One year&rsquo;s hard service had reduced them from two thousand to about eight hundred, in field service, in Rousseau&rsquo;s brigade, composed of the 16<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> regulars. These disciplined troops were called upon as a forlorn hope for the stricken and sinking army, when utter defeat stared them in the face as a certainty. The position was imminent. The word was &ldquo;Forward&rdquo; On they moved, with the unbroken front and dauntless tread, square into the jaws of death. Victory must be wrested from despair; and like their noble brothers, the 4<sup>th</sup> regular cavalry, led by Gen Rosecrans in person, they moved to accomplish their mission. Look at their record; In this regiment the 18<sup>th</sup> along 1 field (?) and 13 officers of the line killed and wounded; of the rand and file 300 killed and wounded &mdash; nearly on-half the entire available force engaged. The 18<sup>th</sup> bore themselves like &ldquo;veterans of the line,&rdquo; and sealed, by their noble courage and heroic death, their attachment to their officers and their country. Lieut. Col. Shepherd commanding and Major Townsend were conspicuous for bravery and heroic daring; eagles of the battalion, their swoop was destruction to the rebel vultures attacked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Victory at length perched upon the banners of our Union, due to the courage, fortitude and perseverance of our able General, supported by such troops as fought and won the blood field of Murfreesboro&rsquo;, in whose ranks should be honorable mentions and perpetuated the United States Regulars, cavalry and infantry.

				<b>THE SOCIAL LAST NIGHT</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Leave Taking of a Venerable Building</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night the social and entertainment at the venerable old house opposite the City Hall was a grand success. It was largely attended. It was something more than a social. About 8 o&rsquo;clock Rev. Vancleave offered prayer. Next came the Secretary&rsquo;s (Mrs. Ella Ross) report, one of the most interesting papers of the kind we have listened to for a great while. The Treasurer, Mrs. Bunnell, mad her report, which detailed the several amounts taken at each social since the ladies formed their present organization, which amounted to $247.56 now on hand. The recitation of the little Miss Sadie Taylor, granddaughter of Mrs. Marchus, was indeed fine. She recited a poem which describes so pathetically, &ldquo;Dollys&rsquo; Cracked Head.&rdquo; Miss Nella Brown, it will be remembered recited it, Miss Sadie fell very little behind that lady in her recitation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then came the reading of a paper concerning the history of the old building in which the present social was being held, prepared for the occasion by Wm. Ross. Below we give a few extracts:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Urban was laid out in 1805 by Col. Wm. Ward. He named the place from the word &lsquo;urbanity.&rsquo; The two first settlers were the Clerk of the Court, Joseph C. Vance (Father of ex-Governor Vance) and Geo. Fithian, who opened the first tavern in a cabin now forming a part of the dwelling of Mrs. Thomas, on South Main street. Samnel McCord opened the first store in the same cabin in March, 1806, when Mr. Douglass Luce came to Urban in 1807, the town consisted of three cabins, one of these was situated on the lot near the factory, upon the old Moses B. Corwin&rsquo;s house now stands. Another stood on the site of our City Hall, and remaining one, of course, was Mr. Fithean&rsquo;s tavern, at which we are stopping a tonight.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Mr. Joseph A. Reynolds moved to Urbana with his family in 1808. Soon after their settling here word was brought after dark one evening that the Indians were meditating a night attack on the town. Orders were instantly issued for all the families of the town to rally at Fithian&rsquo;s tavern.(this building), as that being the largest and strongest building, afforded the best means of defense. So, the citizens in great alarm and confusion, hastily aroused their families, and through the darkness gathered them to await the furious onslaught of the savages. So, for one night this tavern was a fort. These fifteen or twenty families remained in the fort all night, but no Indians came. The alarm proved to be a false one, and entirely without foundation.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Judge Patrick informs me that Mr. Fithian occupied this building as a tavern for probably eight or nine years, say from 1805 to 1813 or 1814. He then sold it to John Enoch (the father of our present Jno. Enoch). He kept the tavern in it for about a year, and then moved away from town. One Mr. Birdsley next occupied it also as a tavern. He remained in it about two years, (perhaps as much as three,) and with his occupancy the place ceased to be used as a public house. The Judge is unable to say who resided here after Mr. Birdsley&rsquo;s time until Mr. Thomas bought the property. Doubtless there are those present to night who can fill the vacancy, and they are cordially invited to do so, and to give any reminiscences that may occur to their minds bearing upon any part of the old house&rsquo;s history.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Those of us who have lived in Urbana thirty years recollect the latest owners, and log residents of the place, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas,. Mr. Thomas in his little shop adjoining the dwelling part of the south, his dwelling strung with watches across the window, plying faithfully and industriously to his calling. Mrs. Thomas, the genial and hospitable woman, it seems like yesterday that they were here.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;This embraces all the items I have been able to gather as to the history of this old tavern, fort, school house, residence, shop, that is tonight entertaining us for perhaps the last time, and I respectfully submit.:&rdquo;
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The evening was highly enjoyed by all present. The refreshments were excellent. Vance&rsquo;s band furnished the music. (1879)
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>OUT WITH THE OLD.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1854, just a quarter of a century ago, the membership the First M.E. church became so large that it was thought advisable to divide the congregation. Accordingly between one hundred and fifty and two hundred formed a colony which has since been known as the Second church. A building committee consisting of J.W. Hitt, Hon. Ira A. Bean, and Hon Francis M Wright, was appointed and the next year the church, which the congregation now leaves, was completed, and made ready for them to occupy, and was dedicated by Bishop Thompson. The meeting of conference was still some months distant and the interval Rev. John T. Mitchell served the church as a temporary supply. When conference met, Rev. J. F. Chaltant was appointed to the regular charge, since which time the pulpit has been occupied as follows: 1857, J. C. Kingsley; 1859 J.J. Thompson; 1861 J.M Robinson; 1863 W. L. Hypes; 1865 L.F. Vancleve; 1868 J. F.Conrey; 1870 Charles Furgeson; 1873 George H. Dart&rsquo; 1876 A. N. Spahr, all of whom are still living.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last Sunday was the last Sabbath they were to spend in their old tabernacle and special exercises were appointed for the day. The Memorial Services in the evening were deeply interesting not only to all the members, but to the numerous friends who were present. The pastor read a history of the church and among other items in addition to those given above we include the contributions to benevolent objects, $7,875.00 and to pastors $20,500.00. When the new church was formed there were but 467 Methodists in the city, but since then, the number this church alone had doubled, while the same prosperity has doubtless followed the parent church.
			</p>
			<p>
				Interesting remarks were made by Joshua Saxton, on &ldquo;The Early History of the church.&rdquo; Robert Outram, &lsquo;Revivals of the church;&rdquo; Mrs. Jos. C. Brand, &ldquo;The women of the church;&rdquo; C.F. Colwell, &ldquo;The Choir,&rdquo; L. B. Happersett and W. W. Wilson, &ldquo;The Sunday School;&rdquo; Levi Geiger, &ldquo;The Pastors and the Dead of the church.&rdquo; Rev. David Warnock followed with a few comments on the life of the church, &ldquo;and when they had sung a hymn they went out&rdquo; with full confidence that the glory of the latter house should be greater than the former and that the Lord of Hosts would give peace. (June 1879)

				<b>On Saturday</b> last Col. Candy and Q.M. Sergt. Wm. R. Ross, of the 66<sup>th</sup> arrived at home. Col. Candy was severely injured in the thigh by a fall on Lookout Mountain, and is at present disabled for service. We hope he will soon be himself again. Sergt. Ross is out of the service, having been discharged on account of disability. He has been with the regiment from the start, and was a popular and efficient officer.

			<p>
				The organ concert at Grace M.E. church, which occurs on the evening of the 10<sup>th</sup> inst., and which is being looked forward to with anticipations of much pleasure, will fully gratify the same. Dr. Thomas Caulfied, who will be the organist for this occasion, is pronounced on of rate excellence, and the names of our home vocalists that appear on the programme, is a guarantee of fine singing. The names of Miss Eichelberger and Miss Baxter alone, on a programme, are sufficient to draw large numbers of lovers of music, while the added attractions of the organist, Dr. T. N.

				<b>Opening of the Parlors of Grace Church</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The elegant basement of Grace M.E. Church was opened with a social, Thursday evening, which proved to be the largest church social that has yet been held in Urbana, the ladies netting in the neighborhood of $125. This opening was none the less a success socially than financially, all partaking of the spirit of genuine enjoyment that very rarely pervades an assemblage under the somber shades of the sanctuary. We cannot refrain from briefly mention the most perfect and inviting arrangements of the basement of Grace church. On passing through the first door, the visitor enters a neatly furnished reception room, leaving which you pass through a hall and then into the fine large L shaped dining room, which could not have appeared to better advantage than on this occasion. The bales were exquisitely arranged, and bore an extensive variety of the most delicious dainties, there being thirty varieties of cakes on the different tables. The ladies also have a complete culinary department, with all necessary table-ware and cooking utensils and two large ranges, indicating plainly the result of the indefatigable industry of the ladies of this church society. The fine dining room has permanent fixtures that would grace any household, including fine lace curtains for the windows.
			</p>
			<p>
				The social was made up of the good people of the various denominations of this city, the First M.E. and Presbyterian congregations especially being largely represented.

				<b>Second Public Concert</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Of the Urbana Choral Society &mdash; Exquisite Renderings Before a Meagre Audience</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The supposition of one would naturally be, upon picking up a programme and glancing over the classical selections that the Choral Society rendered at their concert Monday evening, that, with the acknowledged refined musical taste of Urbana, its people would turn out in large numbers to do honor to the home talent of which they might justly feel a conscious pride. But such did not prove to the case on Monday evening, and the efforts of our best musical instructors and most apt and talented pupils, were accorded an expression of appreciation only to the extent of not a half house. But the soloists and all the members of the society were apparently unmindful of this lack of merited appreciation, and could not have acquitted themselves with greater credit if the hall had overflowed with the most appreciative auditors.
			</p>
			<p>
				The choruses were all finely rendered, giving evidence of the thorough training Prof. Sewall has given the members of the Choral;
			</p>
			<p>
				The Bridal Chorus, &ldquo;Guided by Us and the male Chorus, &ldquo;Hail Kink Henry,&rdquo; for the opera of Lohenrin, by Wagner, were most perfectly rendered and probably aroused the audience to a keener sense of the merit of the concert than any one of the other choruses on the programme.
			</p>
			<p>
				The trio, &ldquo;Memory,&rdquo; was exquisitely rendered by Profs. Sewall and Moses, and Mrs. Smith.
			</p>
			<p>
				The soprano solo, &ldquo;The lost Chord,&rdquo; one of Sullivan&rsquo;s most entrancing inspirations, was sweetly and in a cultured manner, sang by Mrs. Hubbell, who was warmly applauded.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the chorus and quartette from Alceste, by Gluck, the quartette was admirably sustained by Miss Hitt, Mrs. Cabell, Prof. Moses and Mr. Alex. Duncan
			</p>
			<p>
				Decidedly the most pleasing feature of the concert was the soprano solo by Miss Eichelberger, &ldquo;Non Torno,&rdquo; by Mattei. This selection could not have been rendered by any one possessing a less powerful and full voice than Miss Eichelberger, with such pleasing effect. At its conclusion, the audience were not quieted until that lady had sang another selection of almost equal merit, and which was equally as well rendered as the first. When she retired amid the enthusiastic expression of appreciation that is elicited by her every appearance before an Urbana audience.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Uno Notte in Venezi,&rdquo; by Lucantoni, a duo by Mrs. Hattie Read and Mr. Henry Helps, met, as its rendering merited an approbation of the audience by a good round of applause.
			</p>
			<p>
				Miss Counts being unable to appear, her place on the programme was most acceptably supplied by Miss McLain, who is a pianist of rare accomplishment&rsquo;s
			</p>
			<p>
				The concert, as a whole, was a most excellent entertainment, and though the audience was small, it was one upon which the artistic rendering of classical selections from the first authors was not lost.

				<b>Tornado at Urbana Fifty Years Ago This Day</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Monday, March 22d, 1830, was to the people of Urbana, on of the most memorable epochs in her history. It was mild and pleasant in the early part of the day, but at about 10 or 11 o&rsquo;clock it began to haze with fitful southwestern breezes, with alternate sunshine and flitting clouds, until about 1 o&rsquo;clock p.m., I will now say, when a small, black, dense cloud could be seen low down in the southwestern horizon, which gradually ascended and rapidly approached at a seeming angle of about 30 degrees. Spectators were attracted by its marked singularity in many respects. It moved, enlarged, and expanded in quick daring swoops and zigzag gyrations, up, down, and horizontally, with quick, whirling evolutions, and seemed to emit dazzling, bright electrical scintillations, producing the most gaudy fringe-work of which humanity can conceive. As it neared, for a few movements, all nature seemed to be hushed &mdash; not a ripple of air could be felt. The heavens seemed to hang out a dark pall, and all seemed to be immersed in one general gloom. When suddenly the scene changed from a death like silence and breathless calm, to a most terrific and appalling spectacle. The whole heavens were in tumultuous commotion. The storm King, in awful grandeur, rode majestically wrapt in his could panoply to the music of the screeching, howling, and horrific roar of the elements, bearing up in his track in med air trees, fence, rails, lumber, shingles, gates, hay stacks and all manner of debris as trophies of his vast and mighty power, in the demolition of natures garniture and the results of man&rsquo;s labor.
			</p>
			<p>
				The awful sublimity of the scene can not be impressed upon the mind of any who did not witness it. And in much less time than the above can be read, the hole force of the tornado darted down like forked lightning upon the town, picking up and demolishing a small brick building, on the northeast corner of John A. Mosgrove&rsquo;s homestead lot, then occupied by a Richard Baker; unroofing the Luce house, now owned and occupied by Ales. McBeth, on the corner of Miami and High street; then with one concentrated swoop dipped into the town branch, in the present foundry yard, clearing out all the water and sediment in its wake; then ascending, whirled J. B. Eaker&rsquo;s frame house, standing near the front yard of J.M. Gardner, unroofing a log house of old James Hulse that then stood in the rear of the present Lutheran church, destroying all the stables in the vicinity. Then as it imbued with mercy, the cloud leaped over without doing injury to two or three small frames near where Col. Johnson lived a short time since, occupied by Johnathan E. Chaplin and others and then darting down demolished in front a pillared street market house; then taking up a hip roofed and nearly finished, steepled and hip roofed brick Presbyterian church, on the present site of the court house; crumbling it to its foundation, carrying the steeple and other timbers long distances, some of which were hurled through the gables of the J.H. Patrick&rsquo;s present residence, which ad then lately been built by M. L. Lewis, a former newspaper editor, and other timbers striking the building, now known as the Hamilton house, leaving the foot prints to this day, then with a bound this last named house, and what is known as the Glessner corner, were partially unroofed, and throwing down a part of the brick walls, from which two carpenters were only saved by crouching under their work bench, which saved them from bang crushed with the brick and mortar, unroofing at the same time the house then owned by Joseph Reppart, now owned I believe by A. C. Jennings, immediately north of the Hamilton house.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, in its wild freak, the tornado seemed to server itself, and part of it struck and unroofed a log house, then owned and occupied by William Downs, (mason), drawing or rather sucking out the north all form its solid corners of the old brick M. E. Church, (now owned by W. H. Ganson, I believe) evidently caused by a vacuum, produced by the action of the storm, and laid it out in a straight line, without even separating the masonry to any considerable extent.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other segment of the tornado struck the house of Rolin J Harey, near the residence of Captain Bresman and prostrated it to the ground. Then it whirled into fragments in a new frame house, then occupied by George Bell, (school teacher,) a little east of the present residence of Doctor Houston. Would to god it were only necessary to record the demolition of property, but oh no; the controlling spirit of the storm transformed itself into an angel of death, and singled four innocent, beautiful and interesting children at this point, one a little infant, as victims to the dark domain, and clutched them as additional trophies, in the retinue of the storm King, carrying their lifeless bodies immense distances in mid air; and not content with this sacrifice hurled the mother several rods, maiming her for life, and at the same time greatly injured a little girl who happened to be at the house, and who is now a respectable lady of this city, and who carries the evidences of it to this day. Here the two segments of the storm again coalesced; leaving the residence of Jerry Mthis untouched which stood in the present front yard of Mayer Deuel, and next picked up the brick residence of Charles Mathis on the spot where Mrs. West now lives and crumbled it to the lower floor, leaving Mrs. Mathis sitting with a child in her arms, surrounded with the complete wreck of the house, uninjured and unscathed, as a seeming atonement for the work of death at the last point of attack, and then veered north and demolished the oil mill of Jonn Mathis, demolishing his whole stock of castor beans, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point the tornado left our town, pursing its tumbling, pitching swooping course through the Ryan woods taking in the site of the present high school building, hurling, twisting, uprooting the largest trees; on, yet on it speed, ascending and descending, touching the earth here and there, at unequal distances, clearing a track of some 15 rods wide where it came in contact through the State of Ohio, nearly destroying a small town in Richland county, reaching a small town in north eastern Pennsylvania at about 5 o&rsquo;clock the same afternoon, at the unparalled speed of about 100 miles per hour.

				You need not tell me gentle reader, that my effort is a failure; I know it. I feel it, but console myself with the reflection, that no uninspired pen, however ably wielded, can do justice to such a subject. I have failed to catalogue all the destruction in the town; some thirty buildings, including stables, etc., were either partially or totally demolished in the wake of the storm, besides many chimneys and other fixtures in other parts of the town. I might here extend many diversified incidents some very sad, some mirthful, some indeed laughingly ludicrous but will forbear, and will close by saying that immediately after the catastrophe, the citizens of the town and many from the country, met with the council of which the author had the honor of being of the members, and immediately inaugurated measures of relief to the sufferers, and early next morning, marshaled under chosen leaders, commenced the reconstruction of the buildings that the havoc of the storm had demolished. Merchants, blacksmiths, tailors, shoemakers, hatters, tinners, saddlers, wheel wrights, tanners, pump makers, potters, gunsmiths, cabinetmakers, brick masons, and indeed, all classes were metamorphosed into carpenters, plasterers, brick masons, and those who could not labor, furnished means necessary, such a lumber, shingles, nails, glass, cash etc. In addition to contributions from our own citizens, the people of Dayton and some other places contributed and placed in the hands of the town council handsome sums of money for distribution; all the unfortunate families were again provided with new homes and many indeed in less than a month were in better condition than before the storm; thus order and comfort were restored by united effort.

				Now Mr. Editor, if I should be charged with a plagiarism by the readers of Antrems&rsquo;s history of Champaign and Logan counties, you may say to them that I acknowledge the fact that his article is largely drawn from that book, but I have corrected or tried to correct some of its errors; but the better defense I have, is, although I have drawn largely, I claim that is a principle in law, that a man cannot commit a theft upon his own pocketbook, if he is honestly the owner of its contents; and as I claim to be the author of the article ten years ago in that work, I have a right to use if I can better it, and not be chargeable with a literary theft. I will here close by saying that the anniversary of the storm came on this same day of the week that it occurred, and if any of your young readers will ask me what day of the week will be its centennial anniversary, I will answer by saying it will be on Monday, and if they will call on me I can give them a short rule that never fails in making such a calculation.

				Urbana, O. March 25 &mdash; One of the most remarkable men that we have ever heard of is James Gales, an old colored man, who died at the home of his daughter, southeast of this city, today. Various ages are put upon his life, but the most reliable is that of the Census Supervisor, who claims to have come across papers while taking the census that bring his age reliably at 125 years. He has been in this county for more than 50 years, and at the time of his arrival here had children that were old men and women. He has been married three times and the last time he was married in the public highway by Esquire Vance. Until within the last two or three years he has never been forced to use a cane. It is claimed by some that he could read without the use of glasses, but this is a mistake, as he never could read. It is claimed that he was the oldest man in Ohio, if the United States. Another remarkable incident is that he never was servant to Washington.

				DEATH OF A REMARKABLE HORSE
			</p>
			<p>
				A very old and remarkable horse, the property of Colonel John H. James, of Urbana, Ohio, has recently died. The intelligence of this horse surpassed anything I have ever known and was quite equal to any well authenticated case I have ever read of.
			</p>
			<p>
				Old Bonny, like most intelligent people, had decided ideas of his own. One amusing instance of this was a dislike to being hitched, and when this feeling was disregarded, he would deliberately break his halter and then stand half a day by the hitching post. He was never subjected to that accident producing barbarism of blinds, but used his eyes freely to see what was going on behind as well as around and before him. He would stand quietly and look back at the buggy until whoever was getting in was seated, and then would start. He had a different gait for nearly every person that drove him. With those in the habit of going fast he would start of briskly without being urged. With children (for everyone was allowed to drive old Bonny who could sit on the seat and hold the lines) his deliberate and careful movements showed that he considered himself responsible for their safety. When they attempted to urge him with the whip I have seen him look round at them a hundred times with a look that said as plain as words, &ldquo;Children, I understand this business better than you do,&rdquo; and if they still persisted he would give a kind of impatient kick, though scarcely raising his foot from the ground, but go faster he would not.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the colonel he had a kind of dog trot, and it took a vigorous application of the whip to make him change it. When the colonel was in his office old Bonny, though never hitched, stood at his hitching post in front, unless the sun or flies became troublesome, when he would go round the corner and through a narrow lane into the back lot, but could be found in one place or the other, except on a few occasions, becoming impatient at the unusual delay he went home alone. At noon he would go up to the steps and when the buggy was unloaded and all the packages taken out he would go to his box under a tree and wait for his dinner, while at night he would go with equal regularity and alone to the stable. Bonny could turn a buggy wherever is could be turned, and his skill and deliberation in turning in a narrow place or in extricating himself from the entanglement of other vehicles, has often been watched and wondered at by the bystanders. He would turn one way until the wheels were too much cramped or he was in danger of hitting something, and then turn the other way and back or start up, as might be necessary, always watching the movements of his own buggy and of anything that might be in the way. If his master got out he would wait for him, and if he walked Bonny would follow him all about town, stopping when he stopped and starting when he started.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bonny undoubtedly came to distinguish Sunday from other days. Whether this was from the ringing of the church bells or from the later hour he was wanted, or from the direct influx of that wisdom that teaches the sparrow to fly, on Sunday, without the raising of a line, he would turn to the right and go to church, while on work days he would turn to the left and go down town. One of his last exploits was one of his most remarkable. He had lost two shoes and his feet had become a little sore. Pat, the stable boy, who had long believed that Bonny knew more than many men, took two shoes, tied them together with a string, shook them before his face, and hung them across his neck and then started him off alone, and he went four blocks, turning two corners to Ed Hill&rsquo;s blacksmith shop, where he had been shod for twenty years and after the shoes were put on went home alone. I am assured of the truth of this, boty the stable boy and by Mr. Hill, who had for twenty years watched and wondered at his wonderful sagacity. Since his last exploit, I have no doubt Mr. Hill would freely and conscientiously make oath that old Bonny knew more that half of his human customers. Now the <i>Urbana Union </i>informs us that old Bonny&rsquo;s feet have, for the last time, been iron shod to fit them for the rough ways of this rough world.
			</p>
			<p>
				If, as we sometimes hope, and half believe, it is a part of the plan of that wisdom which watches the falling sparrow, that animal life, with its wonderful instincts, and sometimes with its wonderful intelligence, shall reappear on the other side of the curtain that separates this world of matter and shadows and death from the world of substance and spirit and life, there can be no doubt on which side of the great gulf which separates the habitually well disposed and useful from the habitually evil disposed and useless, old Bonny will appear.

				<b>HISTORY OF MOUNT PISGAH NEIGHBORHOOD.</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>I.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The word neighbor is a good old Anglo-Saxon word. Noah Webster says it is formed from neh, nigh, and gebwe, a farmer. Joseph Emerson Worcester says is from neah, near, and bwe, a dwelling. A neighborhood is a company of neighbors &mdash; the inhabitants of a country who live near each other. Nations are formed from neighborhoods. This nation may be compared to a vast tree, to an evergreen &mdash; a live oak, for example. The several states that are the great stems which shoot forth from the giant trunk; the branches fastened to those stems may be likened to counties; the twigs attached to these branches represent the subdivisions styled townships; and the countless number of leaves represent neighborhoods. The leaves are the important organs which elaborate or assimilate the crude sap of the tree &mdash; neighborhoods are the life of the Nation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Neighborhoods are so interlocked or interfaced that it is impossible to decide where one ends and another begins. Their boundaries are therefore indefinable. The mill, the schoolhouse and the church, are the fundamental points around which neighborhoods cluster. They may be regarded as the foundation stones of all well regulated neighborhoods. Man has three fold nature. He should be educated physically and intellectually and religiously. He needs food for his body, his intellect, and his soul. Hence the enterprising, intelligent, and Christian pioneers of every country, as soon as they have secured shelter for their families and their stock, build the mill, the schoolhouse and the church. The progressive development of the citizens of a neighborhood from the rough forest life of the past to the condition of the present, exhibits a picture as instructive as it is interesting. I will endeavor, Deo volente, in a few letters, to give, with the permission of the editor of this <i>Gazette, </i>history of that part of Union township which has been known for forty nine years as the &ldquo;Mount Pisgah Neighborhood.&rdquo; I will commence with the first years of the present century, when a few families residing in the mountainous regions of Virginia having heard of the beautiful and fertile district styled the &ldquo;Miami Country&rdquo; determined to leave the land of their childhood &mdash; its rocks and rills &mdash; to make themselves homes in the uncultivated wilderness. The history of every life worth chronicling is a history of persistent toil and long enduring patience. These men an women, with a sturdy energy and an indomitable perseverance peculiarly their own, pressed forward not knowing exactly where or when their journey would terminate; but they sent up their fervent prayers to the Being who shapes the fortunes of mankind, that His hand might guide and his blessings attend them.

				In a few weeks they found themselves in the noble and marvelously fertile valley watered by Buckcreek and its minute branches. This valley and the hills bordering thereon were singularly attractive to these pioneers of civilization. So their journey westward ended. Amid the grand solitude of the primitive forests they sang &ldquo;their hymns of lofty cheer.&rdquo; In this valley and on these gently sloping hills which presented few obstacles to cultivation, they built their log cabins. Here they dwelt in happiness. The soil was prepared to furnish all the productions needed for their sustenance. They would became known as industrious, honest, and intelligent community. The storms of war severed but to strengthen them, and by the long sunshine of peace they were nurtured. The recognized the fact that if there were no wars, mankind would not properly appreciate the blessings of peace; that without poverty, wealth would lose much of its value; and without darkens, light would become a monotonous superfluity. When they were surrounded by circumstances the most disheartening, the deep faith in their souls heard the should of coming deliverance. Those first settlers have all passed away; but they have left behind them the memory of their simple virtues.

				Although its boundaries cannot be determined with precision, yet we will assume they are as follows: It is bounded north by the Mechanicsburg pike, east by a line drawn southward from Mutual, south by a line drawn eastward from Powhattan, and west to the township line. Its northeast corner nestles in the arms of Mutual, and the southwest corner is protected by the friendly tribes of Powhattan. First in the annals of this neighborhood appear the surnames Runyan, McLain, Lafferty, Minturn, Jones, Clark, Robinson, Reid, Ward, Baker, Hedges, and Garber.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first settlement was made in 1802 by John Runyan and Joseph McLain. They were born in New Jersey. After the close of the Revolution they removed from thence of the State of Virginia. In 1802 they journeyed with their families to Ohio and settled east of the perennial springs which form the source of Buckcreek. John Runyan build his cabin south of what is no the residence of his grandson, John H. Runyan. Joseph McLain build a double cabin a few rods northeast of the spot now occupied by the brick residence of his son, James A. McLain. Here these two men passed the autumnal season of their lives wit htheir families &mdash; and they will be remembered as men of great worth.
			</p>
			<p>
				John Lafferty was born June 8, 1778, near Shepherdstown, Jefferson county, Virginia, on the west bank of the Potomac, about nine miles east of Martinsburg. John Lafferty and Sarah Osborn were married Sept. 9. 1800. In 1801, this young couple set out to make themselves a home in Ohio. They settled first near Waynesville, on the Little Miami, about 18 miles southeast of Dayton. In the spring of 1803, they removed northward to the source of Buckcreek. During the spring and summer of that year they lived near what is now the residence of Samuel Cheney. Lafferty raised his first crop of corn on John Runyan&rsquo;s farm, and built a log cabin north of what is now the residence of George Wolfe, of Mutual. The Mechanicsburg pike passes over the spot where his cabin stood. His son Thomas was born there in November, 1803. This was the first preaching place for the Methodists in that vicinity. In this log house the neighbors assembled to worship &ldquo;the Judge of all the earth.&rdquo; A larger and much better house of hewn logs was, years afterward, build a few rods south of the old house, and the people continued to worship there until several years had elapsed after the death of Mr. Lafferty. He died May 18, 1822. &ldquo;Sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust, he approached his grave like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Jacob Minturn and Jones were born in New Jersey about the middle of the last century. During the first years of our Republic they migrated to Northern Virginia. Jacob Minturn had four sons, names: Barton, Allen, Bunnel and George. The names of Mrs. Jone&rsquo;s children were as follows &mdash; Abram, Justus, Daniel, Hannah and Esther. Barton Minturn and Hannah Jones were married in Virginia. Early in the spring of 1802 all of the Minturns and Jones named above journeyed with their teams westward to the Ohio river, embarked on a flat boat, and floated down the river as far as Cincinnati, then a town of one thousand inhabitants. They stopped about 28 miles north of Cincinnati at what is now Monroe, in Butler county. There they adjourned until the spring of 1804, when they proceeded northward to the ridges bordering on Buckcreek.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jacob Minturn, assisted by his robust boys, built a comfortable log house a few rods directly east of what is now the residence of Mrs. Mary Jones. Here they planted an apple orchard, and some of the trees are standing to this day. I venture to assert there are a few trees in the State of Ohio so gigantic. In November, 1876, a letter was published in this <i>Gazette </i>which gave the dimensions of the trunks and main branches of two of these trees.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barton Minturn, with the help of his father and brothers, built a log cabin a few rods southeast of the brick house which he built about 20 years afterward. His wife, Hannah, died Sept. 29, 1806, and was buried in the graveyard on the farm now owned by his son, Edward Minturn. In that private burying ground repose the ashes of Jacob Minturn, who died Feb. 8, 1817, aged 63 years. Barton Minturn&rsquo;s second wife was Esther Jones, a sister of his first wife. She died July 30, 1849, and was buried in the Mt. Pisgah churchyard. About five years after her death he removed to Urbana, where he lived a few years and then passed away with the sunset sky of life gilded with a sense of duty well done.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abram Jones and his wife Nancy, first settled on the land now owned by &ldquo;Aunt&rdquo; Ary Paul. Their son John was born there Nov. 12, 1804. In 1804 they removed to the farm now owned by Samuel Barnett and built a log house for a residence. The land then belonged to the United States. Abram Jones died Oct 11, 1809, leaving a widow with three small children. One of the children died soon after the death of its father. The widow bravely struggled along, with her children to care for, and succeeded in making the payments on the farm as they became due; and finally received through the Land Office the patent issued from the Department of State and signed by the President.
			</p>
			<p>
				Justus Jones settled on the farm lately owned by his son-in-law, Rezin C. Wilson, deceased. He built a log cabin which stands to this day in the edge of the orchard, a few rods south of the brick mansion built by Rezin C. Wilson in 1840. For many years Justus Jones held the office of Justice of the Peace and before the church was build his house was a place of worship for the Methodists. The Methodists of the neighborhood were formed into two bands or classes. John Lafferty was the leader of the northern band, and Justus Jones the leader of the southern band. John Lafferty died in 1822, as before stated, and William Hendin became his successor as class leader. Justus Jones and his wife died nearly fifty years ago in that old log house which stands by the old apple trees on the hill &mdash; a relic of a past age &ldquo;to sentinel enchanted ground.&rdquo; The winds of winter which pass through its gaping sides sigh a requiem for the departed ones who &ldquo;long years ago in the good old times&rdquo; assembled to pay divine honors to the Supreme Being.
			</p>
			<p>
				Daniel Jones settled on the farm now owned by Edward Minturn. He and his wife died there and were buried in that family burying ground herein before mentioned.
			</p>
			<p>
				John Clark settled on land immediately south of Jacob Minturn. The old house is yet standing and is about a quarter of a mile south of the brick residence of Mrs. Mary Jones. John Clark&rsquo;s son Stephen was born there about 1806. Stephen married Hannah, the daughter of Jacob Minturn; and about 1830 he purchased the farm now owned by Samuel Barnett, and resided there nearly thirty years. His wife, Hannah, died Oct. 28, 1855, aged 49 years and 5 months. She was buried at Mt. Pisgah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allen Minturn and his wife, Rebecca lived for several years on the land which lies northwest of Mt. Pisgah. He then removed about half a mile eastward to the farm first settled by John Clark. He died there April 1, 1855, aged 72 years, 2 months, and 4 days. His body rests at Mt. Pisgah/
			</p>
			<p>
				Bunnell Minturn married the widow of Abram Jones. He purchased his father&rsquo;s farm and there he resided until the day of his death. His wife died August 23, 1847, aged 67 years, 6 months, and 14 days. He died January 25, 1868 after

Pisgah neighborhood.
			</p>
			<p>
				George Minturn successively resided on the Pretty Prairie, in Mechanicsburg, in Columbus, in Lima, on the Darby Plains and in this neighborhood. He removed to Iowa about 28 years ago. He returned in 1864 on a visit, and died, during the summer of that year, on the farm where his father had settled just 60 years before.

			<p>
				Daniel Baker, a native of New Jersey, came here with the Minturn&rsquo;s and Joneses. In 1805 he built his modest cabin back in the silent woods among the squirrels. His farm was northeast of and adjacent to the farm of his wife&rsquo;s brother, Justus Jones. In 1831 he sold 154 acres of the northern part to James Reid; and a few years later, he sold the main body of his farm to William S. Taylor and removed from the neighborhood. Taylor, in 1855 sold the farm to present owner, Frederick Michael; and in 1855 removed to Urbana, where he died soon afterward. <b><u>(</u><i>handwritten notes: underlined: later, he sold the main body of his farm to William S. Taylor; 1855 dates changed to 1854; &ldquo;X&rdquo; by name William S. Taylor, note at bottom of page Father of Ella L(T) Ross).</i></b>
			</p>
			<p>
				He was the father of Lucien Taylor, for many years our county surveyor. I seldom feel inclined to panegyrize, but right here I desire to say of William S. Taylor, that he was one whose modest deportment and strict integrity of character, endeared him to all who knew him. During the many years passed in this neighborhood he had so endeared himself to us by the integrity of character, the urbanity of his manner, the friendly sympathy and active kindness of his nature, and his uniform deportment as a true and modest Christian, that we felt, one and all, when he entered the eternity of rest, that in losing him we had lost not only a most estimable companion, but a friend and brother who loved his fellow man.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next in the list of the names of those men faithful and true, silent and few,--those brawny armed men who cut the white oak forests and hewed away for those to come after &mdash; appears the name of William Paul. He was born in Virginia. In 1802 he came here and settled on a large tract of land lying east of Buck Creek and south of Joseph McLain&rsquo;s farm. He gave each of his children a farm. Many years ago, all, except Ary, sold their land and removed to the west.
			</p>
			<p>
				About the year 1808 Abijah Ward settled on the land afterwards owned by William Vance and now owned by John Kirby. He reared a large family of children and build the house, near the mouth of Dugan, which was for a long period the residence of William Vance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Richard Ward and his brother John settled on the northwest quarter of section 32. John build his cabin near the south line of the quarter on the west bank of the pond known by the obstreperous schoolboys of the past generation as the Fulton pond. &mdash; About the year 1813 John sold his part (60 acres) to Richard, and his cabin was revised and transformed into a school house, where for a short period the children of that vicinity were taught. Of this school I will write hereafter. Richard Ward, in 1828, sold the farm to Thomas Hatton, a native of Ireland. About 1835 Hatton sold to Joseph C. Brand, and about 1844 Brand sold to David P. Fulton.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am to give a chronological order, a concise and unadorned narrative of events and I discover at the outset the disadvantage of not having a memory like a sponge---able to retain everything. James Reid was born near Martinsburg, Berkeley county, Va., Mary 28 1785. In the fall of 1810 James Reid, his wife Christiana, and their children, Catherine and William R., in company with James Robinson, his wife Rachel, and their son Joseph with his wife Eve and their three children, emigrated from Berkley county, Va., and settled in this neighborhood. James Robinson and his son Joseph built their house near Buck Creek, on the farm lately owned by John McCreary, deceased. He bought a large tract of land, including the northeast quarter of section 32 and the farm now owned by the widow of Jacob Conklyn, deceased. Not far from Robinson&rsquo;s dwelling a saw mill stood, which years ago became dilapidated and is now in ruins. James Reid run the saw mill for about one year. During that year his family lived in a small house close by. His son, Robert S. Reid, was born there Nov. 1, 1811. The same year James Reid built a log cabin near the south line of the southwest quarter of section 32. In 1812 he moved into the cabin, and late in the autumn of that year he entered the army and served 6 months. His wife Christiana, died June 30, 1820, ad was buried in the Buck Creek graveyard. In 1853 he sold his farm to his son, Robert S. On March 1, 1854, his second wife, Martha M. died and was buried at Mt. Pisgah. In 1855 he removed to Urbana, where he died Feb 11, 1857, and was buried at Mt. Pisgah.

				I will now give a history of the first gristmill. It was build about one third of a mile n.n.w of the Mt. Pisgah school house by a man surnamed Hais. He cut a ditch up through Dugan prairie to furnish water power, but it failed. The mill was then purchased by Joseph Robinson and hauled down to Buck Creek, where water never fails. This was for many years known as &rdquo;Robinson&rsquo;s Mill&rdquo; James Robinson sold the northeast quarter of section 32 to Seaton Hedges, who lived there a few years and then removed to the Pretty Prairie. The farm then passed into the hands of Jacob Garber. About 1834 Garber sold to Joseph C. Brand, and about 1843 the latter built a substantial brick residence in one of the prettiest spots in all this wooded valley. It stands on the southernmost point of the ridge or series of ridges which separate Buck Creek valley from Dugan prairie. For many years this valley formed part of the famous hunting grounds of that warlike tribe from which Tecumseh sprang. The numerous arrowheads picked up by the industrious plowman attest the truth of this statement.

				James Robinson died and his son Joseph came into possession of all his land. The farm now owned by Mrs. Emily Conkly he sold in 1834 to John Hedges. Hedges sold to Samuel Canada, and in 1839 Canada sold to Jacob Conklyn. Robinson ins 1834 sold his other lands to William S. Taylor, J. R. Taylor and Dr. James McCann. The mills he sold to James A. McLain. The latter sold the mills some years afterward to Robt. Woods, and Woods sold to James Todd. Joseph Robinson and his family emigrated in 1834 to Tazewell county Illinois. His mother, Rachel died there a few years afterward, aged nearly 100 years. About 1836 J. C. Hamilton bought the farm lately owned by John McCreary. About 1838 Ronald Donladson came from Baltimore, Md., and bought the farm of Hamilton. After the death of James Todd, Donaldson bought the mills, tore the old gristmill down and build a new one about fifteen rods father south. About 1857 he sold the farm to John McCreary, the mills to John Hamilton, and removed to Urbana, where he died a few years ago, leaving behind him a spotless character, an endearing memory, and the record of a life that will ever make those who knew him feel honored by their association with him.

				History is almost inseparably connected with chronology and geography. Chronology is the skeleton of history, and geography is the base on which it stands. History without chronology is confused and obscure, and insipid. I have given the names of the first permanent settlers, and have stated when they came and where they settled. But there were others who came here between the years 1802 and 1812 with no determination to remain long. Their habits of life were migratory, and they lived principally by hunting. They built themselves huts somewhat similar to those built by the Indians. They were called squatters, and they sold their few improvements to those who afterward acquired title to the lands and became the first owners of the soil. The first settlers selected the ridges where grew the forests of oak and history, under the impression that the soil which produced the large trees must necessarily be more fertile than that which had brought forth hazel bushes or trees of inferior growth. But in this they were mistaken, and subsequent experience convinced that the barrens, so called were more fertile than the ridges

				The line drawn by Israel Ludlow from the source of the Little Miami, nearly N.N.W., to what was then the southern boundary of the Indian lands, passes diagonally through the eastern half of this neighborhood. East of this line was the Virginia military reservation and west of this line were the Congress lands. In 1816 Champaign, Miami and Darke (the northernmost counties of the Miami country) extended northward to the Indian boundary, and at that time, there remained unsold in these three counties fourteen hundred thousand acres to be purchased at the land office in Cincinnati at two dollars per acre, one fourth of the purchase money to be paid a the time of entry or purchase, one fourth in two years there after, and one fourth in four years; and at the expiration of the fifth year, if the land had not been paid for in full, it reverted to the United States and was then offered at public auction and sold to the highest bidder. A whole section, a half, or a quarter could be purchased by a single individual. A discount of eight per cent, was allowed on all payments made before they were due.
			</p>
			<p>
				A small part of Dugan Prairie is within the bounds of this neighborhood. This prairie took its name from Pierre Dugan, a Frenchman, who was the first white settler upon its boarder. He lived a few miles north of here on this prairie. When the country began to fill up with settlers and game became scarce, he took his Indian wife and traps and removed northward to a point near the source of the Scioto river, where burdened with the weight of years, he closed the final ledger of life.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first settlers had much to contend with. By peril and privation, by toil and trail, by the ordeal of suffering, they came into possession of these lands. They came and the noise of their axes resounded through the forest aisles of the wilderness. Handsome trees were felled. From these trees logs of the proper length were cut and hauled to the spot selected for the cabin. The four walls were formed, and the spaces between the logs were completely closed with pieces of wood and tempered clay &mdash; The floor was made of puncheons or planks formed by splitting logs and hewing them with a broad axe. The roof and ceiling was formed of clapboards. The apertures for the door, windows and fireplace were sawn out. The door was constructed of the same materials as the floor and was ornamented with a wooden latch and a latch string. A log cabin without a latchstring is a failure. The apertures intended for windows were finished with a sort of latticework, and paper, rendered translucent by being greased or smeared with lard or bear&rsquo;s oil, was pasted thereon. This paper thus prepared resisted the rain tolerably well and was considered a very good substitute for glass. The chimney, with its generous fireplace, was formed of sticks and clay, or of stone. The shelves were clapboards supported by wood pegs, and the furniture in simplicity and rudeness of construction, corresponded to the cabin. They pounded corn in a hominy block and used the fine portions for bread or mush, and coarse for hominy. They kindled their fires by means of flint, steel, powder, and tow, and ate their mush and milk with a pewter spoon and from a tin cup. Hominy, Johnny cakes, corn pone and venison must also be included in the bill of fare; and in autumn these plain, blunt and whole souled backwoods farmers ate with a keen relish the delicious wild turkey. Most of the articles of dress were of domestic manufacture. Their homespun garments were made from flax or from the skins of deer. They wore coarse hunting shirts and buckskin pantaloons The latter, when dried after being wet, were uncomfortably had and inflexible. Such was their everyday and holiday garb. The boys went barefooted seven months of the year. Only five or six yards of calico were required for a dress pattern and it cost five or six dollars.

				Hamilton county was established in 1790, and Ross in 1798. In 1803 Green was formed from Hamilton and Ross and Franklin was formed from Ross. On March 1, 1805, Champaign was formed from Greene and Franklin. Jno. Runyan was chosen that year as one of three Associate Judges of the Court of Common Please in Champaign county. Salem township was organized the same year, and this neighborhood was then in that township. Justus Jones was a Justice of the Peace and Daniel Jones was a constable. About the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century the Shawnee Indians, resided in Northern Florida, on the banks of the Suwannee river. Toward the close of that century they migrated northward and were among the tribes occupying Pennsylvania when it was granted to Penn, who made treaties with them in 1682 and 1701. Some years afterward they removed to Ohio. When the first settlers came the Shawnees were here; and, either as friends or enemies, for a time they dwelt contiguous to each other, and their history is blended. Tecumseh was born o the banks of Mad River, a few miles west of where Springfield now stands, and about 16 miles southwest of this neighborhood. In 1795 he was made a chief. About 1805 his twin brother set up as a prophet and denounced the use of liquors and all food introduced by the whites. These two brothers then 37 years of age, attempted to unite all the western tribes into one nation to resist the white settlers. They soon had 400 warriors gathered at Greenville. Their proceedings created a great deal of alarm on the frontier and induced many families in the northern counties of the Miami country to remove back from whence they had emigrated. From 1807 to 1810 the settlers were repeatedly alarmed at rumors of the near approach of hostile Indians. The distance from here to the Indian lands was about 26 miles. They fortified their
			</p>
			<p>
				homes and kept watch against the treacherous foe. In 1810 it became evident to Gen. Harrison that the Northwest would soon be subjected to all the calamities of an Indian war
			</p>
			<p>
				unless decided steps were taken. In 1811 Tecumseh journeyed.

				To the land of his ancestors; and by his eloquence stirred up the Indian warriors of Georgia and Florida. During his absence the battle Tippecanoe was fought, the &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; and his warriors defeated, and the schemes of Tecumseh frustrated.

				At an election held in Union township, on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 1811, Joseph McLain and Jacob Minturn were two of the three judges; and of 68 persons who voted that day, I name the following : Jacob Minturn, John Lafferty, Joseph McLain, Barton Minturn, James McLain, Stephen Runyan, Allen Minturn, Daniel Jones, Richard Runyan, Justus Jones, John Clark, Abijah Ward, John Runyan, and Daniel Baker.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1812 there were &ldquo;wars, rumors of war, and earthquakes in diverse places.: Tecumseh joined the British at Malden, and in 1813 he was made a brigadier general in the British forces. He was in command with Proctor at the siege of Fort Meigs, and saved American prisoners from massacre. &mdash; Fort Meigs, a few hundred yards from the right bank of the Maumee in the northern part of Wood county, was built for the crisis in 1813, and named in honor of Return Jonathan Meigs, who was Governor of Ohio from 1810 to 1814. This fort was besieged from April 28, 1813, to May 9, 1813, 1360 British and 1500 Indians, who were defeated by Gen. Harrison with a little more than 2000 men. This settlement was represented at For Meigs. Abner Barritt (or Barrett) was captain of the company that went from this township, and Edward Jones, the only son of Justus Jones, was a lieutenant. The latter died at Fort Meigs. David Marsh, the husband of Nancy, the daughter of Justus Jones, volunteered. James Reid and Barton Minturn were drafted. The latter furnished a substitute. The march northward through the Black Swamps in the month of January, 1813 was severe. They returned home in the summer of 1813. the great chief of the Indian confederacy fell at the battle of the Thames, Oct. 5, 1813, and the ended in the Northwest.

				In this saying there is more truth than poetry; more force than elegance. It is the statement of a principle which spans human life in all ages and countries. Necessity, convenience, luxury. Indigence, the golden mean, opulence. Poverty, comfort, wealth. The farmers of this settlement, with bright skies above them, pure air around them, and a kind soil beneath their feet, swung the plow and hoe in spring, the scythe and sickle in summer, the corn knife and husking peg in autumn, and the axe and flail in winter. And for their labor they were rewarded. Corn produced about fifty bushels to an acre, wheat twenty-five, and oats thirty; and although pork was sometimes sold for one dollar and fifty cents per hundred, wheat twenty-five cents per bushel, and corn for a fip penny-bit, yet the prices were usually fair. Corn and oats usually sold for twenty-five cents per bushel, wheat fifty cents, port two dollars and fifty cents per hundred, and beef three dollars. The spring and summer of 1816 were very unfavorable for raising wheat, corn, and grass; consequently the prices of produce for a year afterward were as follows: Corn thirty-three cents, wheat seventy-five cents, oats, thirty three cents, buckwheat thirty-seven and one-half cents, butter twelve and one half cents per pound, honey fifty cents per gallon, flour 6.50 per barrel, pork $4.00 per hundred, beef $3.50. In 1816 a good milk cow cost $15, and a good horse $40. Sheep were $3.50 per head. The principal news papers published in the Miami country in 1817, which occasionally found their way to this settlement, were as follows: The <i>Sprit of Liberty, </i>published in Urbana, the <i>Ohio Vehicle</i> in Xenia, the <i>Ohio Republican</i> in Dayton, the <i>Political Censor</i> and the <i>Western American</i> in Williamsburgh, the <i>Western Spy</i> in Lebanon, the <i>Miami Intelligencer</i> in Hamilton and the <i>Cincinnati Gazette and Liberty Hall</i> in Cincinnati. At that time improved farms were rated from five to 15 dollars per acre.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not withstanding hardships, the settlers were generally blessed with health. Ague and fever occasionally visited their cabins, and infrequently the found it necessary to wrestle with an epidemic. Between the years 1804 and 1806, James Walker, whose wife was John Clark&rsquo;s sister, settled on the land now commonly styled the &ldquo;Porter Place.&rdquo; Early in the spring of 1812, after the inhabitants of the American continent had been somewhat shaken by ague and pretty thoroughly shaken and agitated bay a few earthquakes, bilious and typhoid pneumonia, then known as the &ldquo;Cold Plague,&rdquo; appeared as an epidemic in a few localities. Daniel Jones, his wife Elizabeth (the daughter of Jacob Minturn), and James Walker, his wife and one son, all died of this disease in April 1812. Joanna Minturn, daughter of Jacob Minturn, who died a few years afterward, appears to have had a presentiment or previous warning of her death. She was a member of John Lafferty&rsquo;s class. On Sunday, the day preceding her death, she sent a farewell message to her classmates, informing them that she would die the next day at noon. On Monday, the next day, when the hour of twelve drew nigh and the bright sun was near the meridian, her spirit passed to that land &ldquo;where the pure waters wander through valleys of gold, and life is a treasure sublime.&rdquo;

				All the able bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years were enrolled in the militia, and were required to provide themselves with fire-arms. The militia of the State was arranged into divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. The convenient each company consisted of 64 privates. In 1815, James Reid was duly elected and commissioned captain of the sixth company, in the first battalion, second regiment, first brigade, and fifth division of the militia. The commission was dated at Chillicothe, February 24, 1815, signed by Thomas Worthington, who was Governor of Ohio from 1814 to 1818, and countersigned by the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio. The day on which the company, battalion, or regiment assembled for drill or exercise was called muster day or training day. The rules of discipline were the same as those contained in the system prepared by Baron Steuben, which was examined and amended by General Washington prior to its adoption by Congress in 1779. The bright colors have almost entirely disappeared from the wrap and woof of those muster days with their assortment of flint locks, powder horns, homespun hunting shirts, buckskin breeches, and caps manufactured from the skins of bear and raccoon.

				A compendious history of the first schools will be given in the number following this. The facts therein contained were imparted by Edward Minturn, Mrs. Mary Jones, daughter of John Lafferty, and Robert S. Reid, all born in this neighborhood. The first named was born June 21, 1805; the second, December 26, 1807, and the third, November 1, 1811.

				Seventy years ago, on the farm purchased in 1831, and still owned by Edward Minturn, there stood a log house in which was kept and operated a distaff, a spinning wheel, and one of those frames or machines in which a weaver forms cloth out of thread. This modest building was called a loom house; and therein during the years 1811 and 1812 was taught &mdash; with all the patience of a successful weaver &mdash; a private school by George Minturn. (The dates given in this letter are approximately correct.) In 1813, the school was taught by John Owens. The neighbors then built a log house for the use of schools a few rods northwest of the spot now occupied by the residence of Edward Minturn. The traveler who passes over the road near by will observe a culvert. Southeast of the culvert, on the bank where the oaks spread their branches wide is the place where that school house stood. Its chief adornment was a capacious fireplace and an old-fashioned wooden chimney. The floor and the benches were made of puncheons. The fireplace monopolized one end of the building. From the other end and from each of the two sides a log was cut and upright sticks were place, in the space thus formed, so as to be about eight inches apart. Over these sticks were pasted sheets of greased paper. In this quaint long-windowed cabin the pupils of the ridges continued the good work, with the help of a faithful teacher, of solving the intricacies of Noah Webster&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Spelling Book,&rsquo; and Stephen Pike&rsquo;s &ldquo;System of Practical Arithmetic.&rdquo; Nicholas Delong taught during the years 1814, 1815, and 1816. Among his pupils were John and Hannah Jones, Jacob, Edward and Smith Minturn, Stephen Clark, and others. A log house with a broad fireplace and a chimney formed of wood and clay has never been considered fireproof &mdash; The banks of the ravine were only for a brief period made attractive by the presence of this building. It was destroyed by fire in 1816, and during the following year the children were instructed by Hildreth in a cabin on a farm about one mile farther north, now known as the &ldquo;Woods Farm.&rdquo; In 1818 a large house of hewed logs was build on the hill west of Dugan Prairie; and in that house the children living on the ridges, as sell as those on the barrens, were instructed in the rudiments of literature. Lindley Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;English Reader&rdquo; was added to the list of text books. Joseph Knox was the first teacher, Richard Baldwin the second, and Thomas Calloway the third. The last named taught about three years. His labors as a teacher at that place terminated about 1822. The beginnings of a few branches of knowledge were indelibly imprinted upon the minds of the children of that day. They were not &ldquo;tutored in the rudiments of many desperate studies.&rdquo; They were taught orthography, reading, writing, the simple rules of arithmetic, pure morals, and the elements of a just and manly character. The few books they studied were the best then published. Webster&rsquo;s spelling book was the first book of the kind published in the United States. It had a prodigious circulation. In its various editions and revisions fifty-two millions copies have been sold from 1783 to the present time. To its influence more than to any other cause are we indebted for the uniformity of pronunciation in the United States. It was illustrated by Alexander Anderson, the first wood engraver in America. Anderson died in New Jersey, January 17, 1870 aged 95 years. Pike&rsquo;s arithmetic was designed &ldquo;to abridge the labour of teachers, and to facilitate the instruction of youth.&rdquo; It was published in Pennsylvania and was used in many of the schools of that State and this from 1811 to 1840. A copy of that work before me contains 198 pages. All the different parts or rules of arithmetic are treated of. I will name a few. The single rule of three commences with page 72; tare and tret, with 95; vulgar fractions with 129; allegation, with 163; single and double positions with 168, annuities in reversion, with 185; perpetuities in reversion, with 187; and combination with 188. I suppose that one versed in mathematics would classify but few of the examples under the head of abstruse problems.

				Between the years 1811 and 1813, a private school was taught by Sallie Docum at the residence of John and Sarah Lafferty. The children taught at that place were Jane, Thomas, William and Mary Lafferty, William, John and Hansen Neal, and few others. The next school was held in a tenement house on John Lafferty&rsquo;s farm. The house stood near the spot now occupied by Isaac Lafferty&rsquo;s residence. It was a rough log house daubed with mud. Two logs were cut from its sides, and in the interstices thus formed, greased paper admitted light and excluded cold. John McLain, the eldest son of Joseph McLain, presided over and diligently taught this school several terms One night during the winter of 1816-17 the house took fire and burned down. The term school which was being held at that time was concluded in the cabin which John Lafferty built in 1803 for a residence. In 1817 another house for school purposes was built on the spot where the first burned down, and John McLain was again employed as instructor. The fireplace occupied nearly the whole of one end of the building; and the teacher, the pupils, and the door occupied the other end and the sides. During the period embraced between the years 1817 and 1826, the following named children, in addition to those last named, were instructed here: James, William, Sallie, Richard, and Jane McLain; Runyans: Beattys; Huestons; Thorntons: Neals; Lemuel, John and William Barrett; Joseph, John, Rebecca, Ephraim, Mary, Samuel, Sallie, Martha, and Martin Sayres; John, David, Wesley, Catharine, Sarah and Hester Ann Lafferty, and others. The school days of a few named above ended in 1817, and the school days of others began in 1826. I have now given a succinct history of the first schools in the northern part of the neighborhood and would be less dissatisfied with the performance if the dates given were absolutely and critically correct.
			</p>

				The first school house in the southern half of the neighbor was build on the farm then owned by Daniel Baker and now owned by Frederick Michael. It stood a few rods from what is now the residence of the latter, and very near the spot occupied by the barn. Its sides were composed of large rough logs, and its principal features were windows of greased paper and a huge fireplace. This was known as &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s School&rdquo; From 1818 to 1822 the following named children were taught here: Aaron, John, Polly, and Justus Baker, Stephen, Ira, Anna, Charlotte and D.K. Jones; William, Betsey, James and Rachel Robinson, William Catharine and Robert S. Reid; William, Joseph, Betsey, Peggy and Isaac Evans; Nancy, Samuel, Abijah, Larry and James Ward; John, Ary and Robert Paul; George, Ben, Hannah, Sallie, and Oliver Flemming; William, Doctor, Hannah, and Betty McMillan; Abram, Seymour, Jacob, John, Catharine, Lucinda, Maria and Eliza Vanmeter; Clark, Dan, David, Henry, Hannah, Vashti, and Obadiah Cregg (or Craig). About two-thirds of the pupils above named were between the ages of fourteen and twenty years at the time Thomas Moore taught. Between the dates above given the first teacher was Everett, the send was Flood, the third was James Paul, son of William Paul, and the last was Thomas Moore. The schools of that day were made up by subscription. The books used were the same as those used in the northern part of the neighborhood. Samuel Kirkham&rsquo;s grammar was also used in some of the schools. Geography was not taught. About the year 1823 John Ward&rsquo;s cabin, referred to in letter number three, was appropriated for the use of schools, and the teacher was Abram Ward, a son of the owner of the farm. He taught here for three years or more. There were two windows in this school house, which were formed in the manner above described. One extended along one of the sides of the cabin, and the other across the end opposite the chimney. The children who attended this school were as follows: Samuel, Jane, Sallie, Margaret, and H.C. Harper; David Church, Jacob Rebecca and Sallie Ward, James Johnson, William and Betsey Egman, Martin and Sallie Setzer, Smith Minturn, and the children of Mr. Evans, Joseph Robinson, Abijah Ward, and James Reid, named above, and others who lived in the vicinity of this school house for a brief period, whose names are not remembered. The children went one winter (about 1826-7) to a school taught by Stephen McLain in an old log house that stood where the little brick house now stands on the farm lately owned by Samuel T. Hedges, deceased. It was called the &ldquo;Rigdon School.&rdquo; The children living on the Pretty Prairie attended that school. There was a very large attendance, and many of the pupils were twenty years of age.

				In 1825 paper windows and mud chimneys began to fade away and take their places with the other crudities of the dim past. The first brick dwelling house of this neighborhood was built for Barton Minturn in 1826. This house, with the additions which have been made thereto, is still used for a residence. The old part has two stories and a garret, or attic. There are three rooms on the first floor and two on the second. The brick was molded, dried in the sun, and burned in a kiln, at the foot of the hill about ten rods east of the site of the house. Barton Minturn resided here until 1852, when he sold his farm to James D. Hedges.

				In the 1826 the Presbyterians residing in this bicinity built a brick church on the summit of the hill near the southeast corner of the Buck Creek graveyard. The history of this house and the history of the families who worshiped and the faithful pastors and ominent divines who preached within its sacred walls would form a large volume. For a quarter of a century the people met here to worship the Lord; and after the termination of that period the house was torn down and the present building, known for many miles around as the Buck Creek Presbyterian church, was constructed.

				On Saturday, Sept. 15, 1827, a meeting of the householders of the sixth school district (otherwise called West Union), of Union township, was held at the residence of Jacob Garber, on the northeast quarter of section 32. Richard Ward, Samuel Harper, Barton Minturn, Justus Jones, Allen Minturn, James Reid, Crain Valentine, Samuel Jack, James McLure and Jacob Garber were present. In pursuance of an act of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio, passed in 1825, the proceeded to elect a clerk and three directors for the term of one year. Jacob Garber was thereupon elected clerk, and Barton Minturn, Richard Ward and James Reid were elected directors. They then adjourned to meet two weeks thereafter at the same place. At the meeting held Saturday, Sept 29, 1827, there were present Bunnel, Minturn, William Hendrix, Stephen King, Edward Minturn, Joseph Robinson, and all those named above except Justus Jones, Samuel Jack and James McClure. It was resolved to build, as soon as practicable, a brick school house; the foundation of the building to be of stone, its length twenty two feet, width eighteen feet, and height nine feet. It was further resolved, &ldquo;that said house shall be built by taxation upon each householder or others subject to taxation.&rdquo; Barton Minturn was elected to superintend the work. The house was built in 1828 on the northwest corner of Jacob Garber&rsquo;s farm; and from that year to the present time the fountain of intelligence for this school district has been located in that corner at the foot of the hill near the cross roads.

				John Ward furnished the brick. The brick kiln was on the land then owned by Samuel Harper, about one third of a mile northeast of the site of the school house &mdash; The door of the school house was on the south side and the chimney on the east end. There was a window on each side of the door, two on the west end of the house, and three on the north side. The desks ==ten or twelve in number &mdash; were large and clumsy, being about four feet in length and as many feet in length on side farthest from the pupil. Beneath the sloping top of each desk was shelf broad enough to receive and retain a small library. Long, hard benches, two feet high were place close to the walls of the school room, and those pupils who could write and cipher sat on these benches and used the desks in front of them. In the process of time the surface of the desks became ornamental, or rather defaced, with all the embellishments of school boy fancy or ingenuity. The boy who had the pleasure and honor of sitting behind on of these desks after it and its wooden companions had been in use for nearly three decades, did not fail to notice with care that it had been disfigured by one or more of his mischievous knife possessing predecessor. He saw oceans, seas gulfs, straits, lakes, rivers, creeks, continents, peninsulas, islands, capes &mdash; in fact a tolerable fair system of outline maps, or the world in nature, where in the natural divisions of water were represented by good blue and black ink, and the corresponding divisions of land by the original desk. The right proportions too, seem to have been maintained; for the board then before him was about three fourths ink and one fourth desk. In addition to this, there were initials and rude representations of objects animate and inanimate. Those desks are probably no longer in existence; but, if they are, then the hieroglyphics of the past which they contain will afford a history not quite so interesting, perhaps, but almost as difficult to decipher as the cuneiform inscriptions placed on Assyrians tablets when the post diluvian world, metaphorically speaking, was an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes.

				The first teacher in this school house was Abram Ward, who taught during the winter of 1828-1829. The names of others who here endeavored to smooth in some degree the entrance to the temple of literature are Richard McLain, Samuel Robinson and William Lafferty. The last named taught two winters. At this time schools were supported by taxation, and small rate bills, which were abated where there was inability to pay. William P. Thomas taught from Monday, Dec. 1, 1834, to Tuesday, March 3, 1835, inclusive. During that period of 93 days there were 28 holidays, including Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas, and the first day of the year. He taught 65 days or one quarter, for which he received $36. Of that sum $12.26 was public money and 23.74 was paid by the parents of those taught, each pupil being assessed nearly one cent and five mills for every day actually present. The child who attended school for the full 65 days was required to pay 93 cents and 6 mills. &mdash; Thirty three children attended school that winter. Giles W. Thomas sent four; James McCann, Archibald Griffith and Jacob Garber each sent three; Amos Jackson, James Paul, Bunnel Minturn, Stephen Clark, Allen Minturn and Benjamin Rolston each sent two; Elijah Hibbets, Rachel Barrett, Barton Minturn, James Reid, Smith Minturn, Abraham Showers, Robinson Hunter, and Samuel Harper each sent one. The average daily attendance was nearly 25.

				In 1836 there were 52 children in the district between the ages of four and twenty one years. In 1838, the school laws of the State were revised and a common school fund of two hundred thousand dollars was established to be distributed a month the several counties according to the number of youth therein. The number of this school district was changed from six to three. During the year ending Sept. 21, 1838, school had been kept nine months, and the teacher had been paid $14 per month and boarded.

				On Friday, April 15, 1831, the members of the Methodist Episcopal church residing in this neighborhood held a meeting for the purpose of deliberating the question of building a brick house for public worship. This society belonged to what was then called the Urbana circuit, and the preacher in charge was William H. Raper, who presided over the meeting and appointed Bunnel Minturn, William Hendrix, John Fox, William S. Taylor, James Reid, Barton Minturn and Allen Minturn as trustees. By agreement of the trustees, Barton Minturn and James Reid were chosen to superintend the building. A piece of woodland, containing one acre, two rods and three perches on the summit of the hill a few rods east of the little brick school house, was procured from Jacob Garber. The bricks were made about one third of a mile northeast of the churchyard, on the farm owned by Samuel Harper from 1818 to 1847. The meeting house was built during the year 1831. It is about forty feet long and thirty feet wide. Its height is about twenty feet to the top of the roof from the ground and twelve feet from the ground to the eaves &mdash; It has four windows in each side, and two windows in each end. The door is in the south end. The amount of money collected by subscription and donation was $789.901/2, and total cost of the building and its furniture was $947.92. The house was named Pt. Pisgah and was dedicated to Almighty God on Sunday, May 27, 1832, at which time the church belonged to the Springfield circuit, which had been formed from the Urbana circuit. Joshua Boucher was the preacher in charge at that time, and the dedicatory sermon was preached by Richard Brandriff, who, a few months ago, resided in Piqua and was the oldest member of the Cincinnati conference. In 1832, Samuel T. Hedges succeeded John Fox as trustee. The remaining debt of the church was provided for by subscription at a meeting held March 1, 1834. On June 3, 1837, at which time Michael Marlay was the preacher in charge of Springfield circuit, a settlement was made by the trustees with those to whom the society stood indebted; and finally on Dec. 28, 1837, the trustees settled among themselves the balance due for the building of the church.

				I will now make mention of an unusual occurrence or accidental event which came near being a disaster. On a certain Sunday in the spring of 1841 a quarterly meeting was held at Mt. Pisgah. I suppose there are half a hundred persons now living of the three hundred or mere then present. The presiding elder was Zachariah Connell. At the close of the meeting, just as the congregation arose to receive the benediction, one of the sleepers of the floor gave away. Two or Three persons standing above the broken sleeper involuntarily screamed, and others under the excitement of the moment imagined that the side walls of the house were falling outward, and that the heavy arched ceiling was just ready to come crashing downward upon their head. Immediately there was a great panic in the densely crowded house, and a general rush was very naturally and unceremoniously made for the door and windows. In a few seconds all, except a score or less, found themselves in the churchyard looking toward the church, which continued to stand as firmly and innocently as though nothing had happened to mar the peace and dignity of the day. A few persons were somewhat bruised, but fortunately no one was very seriously injured.
			</p>
			<p>
				On De 6, 1841, Joseph C. Brand was appointed trustee to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of William Hendrix. The circuit was then styled the Charlestown circuit, and Levi P. Miller was the preacher in charge. In March, 1842, the trustees met and measures were taken to repair the floor of the church. Joseph C. brand and Barton Minturn were appointed a committee to make purchases, employ workmen, and superintend the work. On March 8, 1843, Ronald Donaldson was elected one of the board of trustees to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of James Reid. The society then belonged to the South Charleston circuit, and Levi P. Miller was the preacher in charge. The whole cost of repairing the church was $100.20. Arrangements were made for paying this debt in July 1843. Lemuel Reynolds, Bunnel Minturn and William Wharton were the class leaders during the palmist days in the history of this humble temple. The graveyard was not fenced until the year 1844. The first grave was made in August 1833, and it holds, in trust, the body of William Raper Jones, son of John and Mary Jones. A few yards south near the long, slender, pendulous branches of a weeping willow, is an old fashioned tombstone, and the inscription thereon tells the reader that Peter K. Naedler, died July 14, 1844, aged ninety-six years and four months. In September, 1848, John Jones was elected trustee in place of Barton Minturn, resigned, and Rezin C. Wilson in place of Samuel T. Hedges. The society then formed a part of the Mechanicsburg circuit, and Edward Estell was the preacher in charge. On Dec. 9, 1857 Robert S. Reid, Edward Minturn, Jacob Conklyn and Amos Wilson were elected trustees, respectively in the places of Joseph C. Brand, William S. Taylor, and Ronald Donaldson, who had removed from the neighborhood, and Allen Minturn, who died April 1, 1855. The class leaders at this time were Joseph Kiger, George W. Strayer, and John Jones.

				The following are the names of the Methodist itinerants who preached in this neighborhood between the years 1830 and 1860: William H. Raper, Richard Brandriff, Joshua Boucher, Ebenezer Chase, Wesley Roe, Joseph J. Hill, Granville Moody, Young, Michael Marlay, Sutherland, Gonzales, Levi P. Miller, James L Grover, Zachariah Connell, Sullivan, David Warnock, John W. Keeley, David H. Sargent, Charles B. Warrington, Stephen Ford Conrey, Samuel D. Clayton, Edward Estell, Joseph Newsom, John F. Marlay, John T. Mitchell, James Kendall, Henry Stokes, Sharp, Selman, Roe, David Kempter, James T. Bail, John Vance, John G. Black, William B. Jackson, William N. Williams and others. Some of those named above deserve special mention. &mdash; Their sermons were fine in rhetoric and satisfactory in substance; and probably no attentive listener ever heard them preach without carrying away in his memory some valuable thoughts. The wisdom of Solomon, the prudence of Sergius Paulus, the tenacity and vitality of Paul, the boldness and firmness of Shadrach and his companions, the patience of Job, the kindness of Nahash, the meekness of Moses, the industry of young Jeroboam, the learning of Gamaliel, and the faith of Timothy&rsquo;s maternal ancestry, were exemplified by these itinerants.

Twenty four boys and eleven girls attended his school. Joseph Reque commenced his first quarter August 27, 1849, for which he received $20 per month. For the second and third quarters he received $21 per month. He subsequently taught a nine month&rsquo;s school commencing October 14, 1850, and ending July 24, 1851. There were 40 pupils enrolled (26 males and 14 females) and the average daily attendance was 22 and a small fraction. He received $22 per month and boarded himself. He taught : orthography, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, English grammar, algebra, geometry, philosophy, and astronomy. During the summer and fall of 1856, &ldquo;the little brick on the corner&rdquo; was torn down and another school house a shade more modern in style was built, by Freeman and Miller, a few feet farther east. In this new building John Morgan taught during the winger of 1856-7 and the following spring. This building was building was used for school purposes about 22 years. It was then sold, and the present school edifice was erected in the corner of the grove near by.

				The Mt. Pisgah Sunday school society came into existence on Sunday, April 3, 1831. On that day its constitution was approved and established, and the association still retains a portion of its original vigor. Its object, as set forth in the preamble to the constitution, is &ldquo;to aid in the instruction of the rising generation in the first rudiments of the English language, and to impart a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.&rdquo; The society was made auxiliary to the M.E. Sunday School Union which was formed in 1827 for the promotion of Sunday schools. A president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, librarian, superintendent and five managers, chosen on the first Sunday in April of each year, constitute a board to transact business.

				John Jones was born in this neighborhood Nov, 12, 1804, and died here July 15, 1876. For nearly forty years his personal history is the history of the church here; its trials, its hopes, and its fears. He was one of the workers here when the foundations of the meeting house were laid, when the walls were reared, and the dedicatory sermon pronounced. He nurtured and sustained the society in its youth, rejoiced when it stood in the strength of its manhood, and after it had passed the zenith of its glory, he contributed much to prolong its existence. He was one of the few loving friends who gathered around it when it was almost ready to fall. He devoted himself especially to the cause of Methodism; but, at the same time entertained a fraternal feeling for members of other churches, and gladly did what he could to help them in their &ldquo;work of faith and labor of love.&rdquo; The name citizen with him implied honor and honesty. He feared only what was wrong and aspired to nothing but what was right.

				Yesterday was set apart by the pastor of Grace M. E. Church as a day for the celebration of Methodism in this county. The exercises were of an interesting character, and participated in by several members of the congregation. The first services were held at 9:30 with a general experience meeting. The attendance was not so large as it should have been, but a good meeting was enjoyed by those there. At 11 o&rsquo;clock Rev. Dr. Pearne made a short introductory address and then called on Levi Geiger, who spoke on &ldquo;The social element of Methodism.&rdquo; J.C. Brand followed with a talk on the history of Methodism in Urbana, from the time it was first introduced by John and Jane Reynolds until the present time. W. W. Wilson and C. F. Colwell were to have spoken but were unable on account of sickness. J. G. Talbott spoke on the &ldquo;cooperation of the work which Methodism seeks.&rdquo; In the evening P. B. Ross spoke on &ldquo;Reminiscences of Grace Church.&rdquo; W. R. Ross read a splendid paper on &ldquo;The Sunday School,&rdquo; and T. D. Crow on &ldquo;providential character of Methodism.&rdquo; Mrs. Pearne closed with an address on &ldquo;Methodism and the Home.&rdquo; The services through were interesting and listened to attentively by all present. At the close of the morning service a plan was submitted by which it is intended to wipe out the debt on the church by conference time. There is now a debt on the church and parsonage of $4000. The ladies of the church agree to pay half of that amount, provided the congregation will raise the other half. There is a very strong inclination on the part of the membership to accept the proposition; and clear the church property. When this debt is wiped out, the congregation of Grace Church will be in a splendid condition financially. They will hold church property to the value of some $40,000, and have it clear of debt. The congregation should by all means wipe it out. (Handwritten: Dec &lsquo;29&rsquo; 1884)

			<p>
				The Culbertson&rsquo;s, Hoges, Zane&rsquo;s, McIntyre&rsquo;s, Young&rsquo;s et alii, who before this country began blazed their way over the hiss of Ohio while with rifle and compass they made their roads through the State &mdash; By Federal grants of land and propagandist energy &mdash; were not merely Presbyterian and Methodist household words, but household companions of my grandparents and parents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Father David Young, who married the widow of John McIntire, one of the founders of Zanesville, was to me a being of another world, and of antique mould and manner. His Druid like beard and aspect, his quaint ways and exclusive manners, and his natural humor and eloquence made him seem the ideal of a presiding pioneer elder. In my boyhood, however, he preached but seldom, taking turns, in the absence of the state minister, with an uncle, Samuel J. Cox, in the old frame church at the intersection of Second and Main streets. There was not a little poignancy in my heart, when I saw the old church where I had so often worshiped, or rather attended, razed to the ground. Was it not there I attended my first Sunday school? There it was that I learned my Bible verses and received my red and blue tickets for proficiency. There it was that I accomplished the memorable task of reciting all of St. Paul to the Romans, under the gentle guidance of the Rev. William P. Strickland, then a clerk in my uncle&rsquo;s post office, and since a shining light and ready writer in this Church.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was there that I used to hear Joseph Trimble, when he brought his first fruits of oratory to the alter. It was there in that old southwest corner &mdash; where the &ldquo;Amen&rsquo;s&rdquo; were much pronounced &mdash; that I realized, in my childish fashion, that I was unregenerate and sinful. It was from thence that I went to my home convicted, and entered the closet to cast of my little burden of sins and woes with an infantile orison; alas! Only to be discovered by a too vigilant mother &mdash; who had all too frequently missed her plum preserves and jumb sugar &mdash; to be sent to bed with all my imperfections on my head annealed, sore, and not a little revengeful.
			</p>
			<p>
				But this old frame haunt of Methodist piety had its time to fall. Along with it went the old coal scuttle bonnets of the elderly Quarterly women and many plain and beautiful customs of the early Church.
			</p>
			<p>
				A brick &ldquo;meeting house&rdquo; of larger dimensions and more pretentious was to be erected. My grandfather was on the building committee and in the absence of a better workman, it was my awkward hand which marked out upon the stone the awkward glypyics which designates the sect and dates the time of the erection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Happy Arcadian days! Eheu! How they have glided into the abyss and rearward of time! I only recur to them to show the pious readers of the Independent how a Democrat &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; religion and what a fall, in their opinion, he has had, by reason of his unregenerate politics.
			</p>
			<p>
				These early memories were cut in durable stone. Tarnished by worldliness, dusted with the activities of life, they have pursued me through the various vicissitudes of studious professional, literary, and political life. They became the nucleus of studies in college; they were coats of mail in the struggles against selfishness and skepticism; in the fine, they prefigured and preordained my choice of spiritual belief, as against the delusive sophistries of new philosophies and mere material science. They have enabled me in following and studying the physical advancement of the past quarter of a century, to perceive in all the atoms, forms, and forces of nature and the phenomena of mind the truth and benignity of the great scheme of human redemption, which is founded on the veracity of Christ, and becomes, with relapsing years, ore beautiful with the white radiance of an ennobling spirituality.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this intellectual stability &mdash; upon the rock of truth &mdash; is there not some compensation for the shortcomings of our daily conduct? Is this denied by the purist? Will he abide no deflection from the fixed right line of known duty&rdquo; Ah It is much to know the line, even if one can not always walk to it lineally and uprightly.

				Grace church of this city has placed the top sheaf on their work, and can now look on their beautiful church edifice and home lie parsonage with a satisfied air, having yesterday met and lifted the last debt that was hanging over the property. The debt which was paid yesterday was principally due on the parsonage they purchased four years ago, which with the interest, had reached $4190.85. The ladies&rsquo; society of the church had $1456.60 in their treasury, which they proposed to apply on the debt, provided the congregation would raise the balance. In addition to the above they raised $500 as a memorial fund to the late Mrs. A.N. Spahr, under whose leadership they were so successful in raising money. This left a balance of $2234.25 for the congregation to raise. Dr. Pearne and the official board went to work on the fund and in a short time hand arrangements made to raise the balance, and a few weeks ago the matter was brought before the congregation and the amount pledged to be paid on August first. The subscribers came up promptly with their subscriptions, and by noon yesterday the amount was in bank ready to wipe out the debt.
			</p>
			<p>
				The congregation met at three o&rsquo;clock and after praying and signing for a short time, W. W. Wilson read the report, showing that the debt was cancelled and the church free. The congregation then sang &ldquo;Praise God from whom all blessings flow,&rdquo; and was dismissed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The work accomplished by the congregation in the past seven years shows what a united and energetic congregation can accomplish. The church was begun in 1878 and completed in June, 1879. The entire cost of the building and furniture and the parsonage reached about $30,000. Add to this the current expenses of church and the benevolent contributions in the seven years, and it aggregates about $50,000. The congregation has raised the entire amount among its members with the exception of less that $1000 that was contributed by persons of other churches. This is an average of $7000. per year. When it is taken into consideration that the congregation is of moderate means, and the extent of the
			</p>
			<p>
				work accomplished by them alone, it demonstrates what sacrifice and love for the Christian church will do. The congregation now has one of the most handsome church properties in the state, and what is better still, it belongs to them. The ladies&rsquo; society of the church raised $6113.30 of the amount.

				For special reasons we depart from our usual custom, and reprint a long obituary. Its subject, Miss IVVA BRAND, of Urbana, daughter of Mayor Brand, and sister of Mr. W. A. Brand one of the editors of the <i>Citizen and Gazette</i>, was a young lady of wonderful personal qualities. Unknown to herself, she was a leader in the great Temperance movement in Urbana last winter, and we sincerely believe that her whole souled interest in that work had much to do with the marked results of that movement. Indeed, at Urbana did what is known as the Crusade achieve its highest results. The deceases was first in the filed and last to leave it; and as she was well known in this city, and as the memoir, written by her brother, is well written, and intrinsically interesting, we copy it in full below:
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Memoir</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Ivva Brand died at her home, Saturday evening, February 27, 1875, at the age of eighteen years and four months. She was the youngest daughter of Hon Joseph C. and Lavinia Brand, and the youngest child of a family of eleven.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her experiences of the world were much beyond her years, and the finished education of her life was much brightened and made more effective to her purposes by contact with varied peoples and changing climes. An innate love of the Beautiful instructed her eyes and vision to the great works of art and the grand scenes of landscape and mountain and valley of Europe and America, expanded her mental powers to a high degree of cultivation. Modest and reserved in all things, her strength of character and mind was known only to her family and more intimate friends, though every acquaintance saw in her acts the thoughts of a most lovely child.
			</p>
			<p>
				No subject of the world&rsquo;s interest was ever brought to her notice upon which she did not form and express an opinion, and so clear, concise and rapid were her conclusions and decisions, that she seldom erred in these judgments. Always at an opportune moment were heard those opinions, which would frequently startle the minds of her friends, and always carried weight with them without the force of argument. Her mind was a true model of that perfection which may be attained by a strict discipline, self-imposed; for no restraint has ever been inflicted upon this, the youngest, loveliest, truest, and best.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two great attributes attached themselves to her heart and made her magnet of love to all with whom he came in contact. These were: Affection for her family and love for her Heavenly Father. Never for a moment did she forget to pour out the quiet love of a heart brimming over with joy and gratitude and none could but feel it. Not demonstrative, but out of the eye and in the words carried the tell-tale story of her love and affection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under the light of a good mother&rsquo;s example she grew into womanhood, and into conscious enjoyment of a Christian experience. She had no experiments, but walked the path of righteousness for her Master&rsquo;s sake, and with a hope that fears not, faulters not; and needs no mercy. She suffered, and enjoyed the parallel between her sufferings and those that ended on the cross; and the soft, bright sunshine that fell upon her heart was always a clear token that God had proven her.
			</p>
			<p>
				She had been an invalid nearly a twelvemonth, and exhibited throughout the time an unequaled degree of fortitude and patience. Never had she uttered a complaint, or murmured against the providence of God, in visiting pain upon her. She rejoiced in the promise here told:
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<u>&ldquo;</u><i>In the furnace God may prove thee,</i>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<i>Thence to bring thee forth more bright, </i>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<i>But can never cease to love thee;</i>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<i>Thou are precious in His sight:</i>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<i>God is with the &mdash; </i>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<i>God, thine everlasting light!&rdquo;</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Death placed his icy finger upon her brow two days before the final dissolution, and while she knew he had claimed her for his own, in those slow and tiresome moments, her spirit was lead on, and on, to the supreme eminence of earthly glory &mdash; a triumphant victory over the shadows, and sorrows, and tears, of a death bed. Two days of sleeplessness, strength wasted with flesh, she grew weary, and wearied into exhaustion but uttered no murmur of complaint. Tired she wanted rest; but there was no sleep for her save in that sleep of death. There was constantly with her a greater presence than suffering, and her mind held and fed upon a greater philosophy than science can herald. Pain had forsaken her, and her only suffering was that terrible weariness. Out of this most horrible feeling she looked with clam and dignified composure, and sweetly said, &ldquo;Christ suffered!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Years ago she formed an idea that she had a mission to fulfill on earth, and it was consoling to her to believe it to be the care of her aged parents. During her protracted illness she had a strong faith in recovery, that her mission might be fulfilled. When she saw the approach of death, and felt the early hope of her mission fade away, she looked for other work that must have been appointed to her to accomplish in the end of her mission. Almost as the star in the east, her work rose up before her, and became as distinct upon the clear sky as was that star to the wise men, and she followed it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Three weeks before, she had confided to her mother a message for one of her brothers &mdash; one who was out of the pale of church discipline and not devoted to active Christian duties of life. Friday evening, twenty-two hours before her death, she called for that brother and requested the message to be delivered. The brave, heart-wrung mother could not tell it there, and it was communicated in a distant room. This was the message: &ldquo;How fondly she had loved the delaying brother; how her affection for him was stronger, more intense that for the others, because of solicitude; how an abiding faith in Christ had sustained her and comforted her throughout her affliction and made her lover her family and be good to them. And she asked him to seek and find and depend upon in every hour, that Christ who had given her such peace and such happy days.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The brother came to her side with a heavy heart, for he loved her as his own soul, saying: &ldquo;My darling Ivva, the message is delivered.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;The promise!&rdquo; &mdash; On the promise! &mdash; she cried. And fondly kissing her questioning face he gave her the promise. The face beamed with the glory of her joy &mdash; she looked angelic, as she gasped and gurgled out the words: &ldquo;Thank you! Oh, tank God! Bless you, my dearest brother!&rdquo; That joy was so awfully great to her that she trembled in every nerve, her eyes almost glittered with satisfaction,and a halo of magnificent beauty seemed to wreath her head as she called to her eldest brother, &ldquo;Oh, Pray! Pray!&rdquo; And the eldest knelt in the large circle around her bed and offered a beautiful prayer for her glory and for their trust. The she said, &ldquo;Oh, you have made me so happy---you &mdash; and you &mdash; all &mdash; Oh, I feel like I could almost get well again.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Steadily, through the long weary hours of night she approached the hour of departure. Each hour found her weaker, but the concentration of the great glory of her life grew more intense. At five o&rsquo;clock Saturday evening, nothing remained of action but a clear voice, a clear intellect, and rapid respiration. When she could no longer find relief in caught, she said to their mother, &ldquo;I can not breath &mdash; I must die!&rdquo; Placing her hand on her throat, she asked Dr. Goddard, her attending physician, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Ivva, you know you are dying, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo; She asked immediately, &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; Choking down the struggling emotions of his heart the Doctor said &mdash; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost home. It&rsquo;s only a little while.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Who of us is so brave, or who has the philosophy of science so true, as to receive that announcement without a tremor of fear? That child of Faith feared not, but smiling as one who ascends a throne to reign and govern, she raised her eyes to his and replied: &ldquo;Thank you! Thank you! Bless the lord for rest!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				She had reached the summit of her greatness and she made her appointments composedly as one who sets her house in order. Nothing was forgotten in the hurry to death. Calling her physician she thanked him for his care and attention. Kind friends who during her sickness and in her last hours were with her ministering to her, were given her warm thanks and God&rsquo;s blessing. One by one the family approached, and from each was exacted a promise to meet her in heaven. As she kissed her father, dearer to her than life itself, she said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll meet above!&rdquo; Through is tears he answered, &ldquo;Yes, daughter, you&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo; One brother approached, and she made the wonderfully significant remark: &ldquo;There is the One!&rdquo; The youngest brother &ndash;in-law stooped and received a last word from her, kissed her fondly, bade her good-bye &mdash; and then she said, &ldquo;My work is finished!&rdquo; and looking up into her brave mother&rsquo;s eyes, with a slight wave of her hand, sweeping the entire family gathered there, she continued &mdash; &ldquo;My Mission! An unbroken family in Heaven!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Her mission was accomplished un unutterable glory, and from the topmost height of spiritual greatness, she reached out her hands and was welcomed into Heaven. Christ had led her on.

				<b>Death&rsquo;s Doings</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Miss Ivva Brand, youngest daughter of Hon. Joseph and Lavinia Brand, died at her home in Urbana, last Saturday evening, February 27<sup>th</sup>, after a long and painful suffering, in the 19 year of her age.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ivva was the youngest of nine children, and perhaps, the most patient of them all, for she had been in poor health for several years. It is said that experiences of the world add much to the refinement of education and the teachings are such that it leaves an impressive stamp upon the mind, and brightens up the intellect; so with little Ivva.
			</p>
			<p>
				She had been an attentive observer of all the notable things, both animate and inanimate &mdash; of this world, and her life study was to learn, not so much for her own good as the good of others, so that she could, at a glance, give an opinion worthy of the brightest consideration for the benefit of all with whom she become intimate.
			</p>
			<p>
				She was a kind-hearted, gentle being; always ready to lend a helping hand to the poor and unfortunate; and giving advice with such earnesty of purpose and knowledge, that was remarkable for one so young. She was a great lover of her father, mother, brothers, and sisters, and her Heavenly Father.
			</p>
			<p>
				She always, through life, though she had a special mission to perform; and, until within a few hours of her death, supposed it was to live to teach all to love and cherish, as she had learned to do; but her mission was to meet her own dear family around her death-bed and bid each one good-by, and ask them to meet her in Heaven.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several years ago she, with her mother and an elders sister, embarked for Nuremburg, Bavaria, one other the German States, where her father was living; he being at the time United States Consul. When she arrived in that country she was to able to speak a work of the German language, but, in an incredible short time, she learned to speak, read and write the tongue. While there she formed a large acquaintance and made may friends. Now, that she has gone to her Heavenly home, let us profit by her example and finally meet her there.

				<b>Mr. Wm. A. Brand, </b>died yesterday evening at the residence of his father-in-law, Mr. J. Saxton, after a lingering illness, which he bore with great patience. For a week or ten day&rsquo;s past his condition had greatly improved, and hopes were entertained of his recovery; but under a relapse a few days ago, with a new feature of disease, he has gradually sank, and expired as above stated, in the 42d year of his age.
			</p>
			<p>
				For twelve or fourteen years, Mr. Brand was connected with the <i>Citizen </i>office, and did good service in the Republican cause being a pungent writer, until a few years ago, being disabled by disease, he was compelled to forego the active duties of office life. Mr. B. has a good war record, which we have not time to write up now, but will be given hereafter. He was one of the noble men of earth, generous to a fault, and was held in high esteem by all who knew him. At the time of his death he held the position of Postmaster of this city. Funeral at 10 o&rsquo;clock Saturday morning.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>IN MEMORIAM.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				W.A. Brand, who as was announced in last week&rsquo;s issue of the <i>Citizen </i>died on Wednesday, May 14, 1879, was born in Union township, Champaign county, O., July 9, 1837.
			</p>
			<p>
				At an early age he removed with is father&rsquo;s family to Urbana, which continued to be his residence till death. He was educated at the public schools of this city and at the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware.
			</p>
			<p>
				He studied law with col. John H. James, graduating at the Cincinnati Law School in the spring of 1858. Soon after he formed a partnership with the Hon. Moses B. Corwin which continued until the latter retired from practice on account of age.
			</p>
			<p>
				July 12, 1859, he married to Miss Frances R. Saxton, who survives him.
			</p>
			<p>
				He continued to practice law till September, 1861, when he enlisted in the 66<sup>th</sup> O.V. I. In January, 1862, he went with his regiment to the field and served in every campaign with his regiment as an enlisted man till 1864 when he accepted a commission as First Lieutenant and Regimental Quartermaster, having frequently declined promotion when previously tendered. He served during the war, resigning his commission only after the declaration of peace whilst his regiment lay at Washington awaiting transportation home.
			</p>
			<p>
				In July, 1865, her purchased a half interest in the Citizen &amp; Gazette and his connection therewith continued till February last, when he disposed of his interest to C. T. Jamieson, the present junior editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				In January 1878, he was appointed Postmaster at Urbana by President Hayes an held that position till his death. He accepted this office in hopes of restoring his health which had been seriously impaired by too close confinement and overwork in his editorial duties.
			</p>
			<p>
				He was a member if the I.O.O.F., of the I.O.R.M., of the K. of P., and of the O.U.A.M., whilst a lodge of that order existed here. In the Odd Fellows he took high rank, passing through all the offices of the Sub Lodge and Encampment and was Representative to the rand Lodge. In the Red Men he was Great Sachem, the highest office in the State organization, and for several years past was Representative to the U. S. Great Council. His genial disposition and admitted ability won him many friends in these orders, as was amply attested by the many telegrams and letters of condolence received from various points after his death.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such are some of the leading incidents in the life of one who filled a large space in the esteem of this community. In giving an estimate of his character, it is difficult for one who knew him as well and intimately as the writer, to give him just mead of praise without seeming to indulge in fulsome panegyric.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his domestic relations, which after all best reveal the real man, he was conspicuously a model. His affection for the various members of his father&rsquo;s family, more especially for his mother, was proverbial. His lover for his wife was in the highest degree tender and chivalrous and their union was one of such rare felicity and happiness as to attract attention and remark from all.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a friend he was true and generous to a fault, always to be relied upon in storm as well as in sunshine. A man of most positive characteristics, he extended to all, the privileges he claimed for himself. A warm, decided and active Republican, he never allowed political differences to engender ill feeling, or to interfere In the slightest with his personal or social relations. Said, since his death, one of the most decided, active Democratic leaders, &ldquo;In the midst of the most excited and bitter contests, when almost every one seemed ready to cut my throat he was my true friend.&rdquo; A Republican from conviction, and feeling that he was thus laboring to save that for which our armies had fought, whilst giving stalwart blows in legitimate contest, he never degenerated into abuse or personalities. Nor would he allow others to use the Citizen as an organ of personal spite. Relentlessly would he weed out any exhibition of personal malice from the articles of correspondents. And he did this too when influential party leaders wrathfully insisted upon an opposite course and when it required no small degree of stamina to refuse. No slight praise this, at a time when so many publishers yield to the temptation to render their papers spicy ad piquant by dragging into their columns private affairs, no matter whom or how deeply it wounds. He introduced steam presses and made the job department of the Citizen superior to any in the west, outside of the great cities, attracting a large amount of work from abroad, much of it of the highest style of the art.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those who went forth to battle for their country he entertained a warmth of regard an esteem amounting almost to affection, and his seem to increase rather than diminish with the passing years. No effort or sacrifice in their behalf was to great. With great perseverance and labor he compiled a record of those from this county, who fell in war for their country, and his strenuous efforts by extensive correspondence and travel to gather materials for the completion of a long cherished purpose to write a history of the campaigns in which he participated; in order to correct some false history already written,, had much to do in hastening his death. But one of the contemplated series, an account of the campaign in Shenandoah Valley, had been written and published, which was said by a General engaged therein to the finest and best description yet give. Had he lived to complete this purpose, the &ldquo;truth of history&rsquo; would have received valuable additions from his hand and some laurels now falsely worn would have been place upon other brows.
			</p>
			<p>
				His generosity was unbounded, never refusing an application for charity, not even making an inquiry as to whether its object was worthy, his theory being to give always, lest, perchance, the most worthy might at times be refuse. To one of our grocers he has, within the course of a few years past, paid hundreds of dollars for provisions which he ordered sent to the needy of all creeds, colors, and nationalities. Thus did he fulfill the injunction, &ldquo;Let no thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				He was always the advocate of wise and enlarged plans for the improvement of our city, and no worthy public enterprise lacked his aid and approval. In his death we have lost one of our most public-spirited an valuable citizens whose place will be hard to fill.
			</p>
			<p>
				For several years past he has suffered greatly from disease, which he bore not merely uncomplainingly, but with a resolute determination and continuance at duty amount to heroism. He died in full trust in the atonement of his Savior.

			<p>
				Of the esteem in which he&rsquo;s was held, the large concourse at his burial gave conclusive proof, and hundreds felt as they followed his remains to our beautiful resting place for the dead, that they had lost a personal friend and society a benefactor. Thus has passed away in the prime and vigor of manhood one who, had his life been spared, would have adorned a still high sphere in our state and national councils, for which his character and ripening abilities so well fitted him.

				In concluding this slight tribute we can not refrain from expressing the hope that the sincere sympathy of our whole community, freely extended to him in this sad affliction, may serve to soften the grieve of the bereaved wife and family.

				Last Saturday morning friend and relatives gathered at the residence of Mr. Joshua Saxton to bid a last farewell to him whose death was felt by all as a bereavement, and to accompany the remains to their last resting place. The funeral services began at 10 o&rsquo;clock by prayers by different pastors of the city, followed by a sermon and sketch of the life of Mr. Brand by Rev. David Warnock. The services being concluded, the obsequies were then conducted by the Order of Red Men, and the escort was formed in the following order:

The record of the deceased as a brave soldier, a sagacious politician, a brilliant writer, a public-spirited man, an active and valuable member of every order which he adorned by his presence, his great heart and silent but never ceasing, never failing, charity, brought forth funeral honors seldom witnessed or more deserved.

				<b>Reunion at Mechanicsburg.</b>

			<p>
				The reunion of the Sixty-sixth O.N.G. at Mechanicsburg, on Tuesday, was one of the best of late years. Every one present enjoyed himself, and many comrades met for the first time since the war closed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The regular proceedings we give below as the most satisfactory account that could be rendered.

			<p>
				In the evening Hon. Charles Foster addressed a large crowd in front of the Darby House, the speech being only moderately political in view of the circumstances. After Mr. Foster&rsquo;s speech the Town Hall was soon filled with auditors eager to hear General Kennedy&rsquo;s oration. Of this able effort everyone spoke in the highest terms, and we are pleased to announce that it will appear in full in the CITIZEN AND GAZETTE next week. The singing by the glee club was timely and well received, and added to the exercises.

			<p>
				The Sixty-sixth regiment I&gt;V&gt;I&gt; met in the armory of Company H, Seventh regiment, O&gt;N&gt;G&gt;, in Mechanicsburg, August 2, and under the escort of that company marched to the Central Ohio Fair Grounds. On arriving at the grounds, John T. Mitchell, President of the Association, called the audience to order, and Chaplain W. R. Parsons offered up a prayer. Minutes of last reunion read and approved. The chair then appointed committees on nominations and resolutions and also a committee to report resolutions expressive our loss occasioned by the death of comrade William A. Brand. Dinner being announced, the association adjourned to the tables, loaded with such a repast as the ladies of Goshen only can give. After a short time spent in hand shaking among the veterans, the association again assembled at the stand, when letters of regret from general E. B. Tyler, Colonel Candy, James Williams, Captain C. W. Kellogg, Captain M.L. Shaw and others were read. The committee on resolutions reported the following which were adopted.

With the usual vanity of men, we regard ourselves well qualified to pass judgment upon a good dinner, well served, and we enter as our unanimous verdict that the ladies of old Goshen have covered themselves with glory. By the memories of old times in the service, and in the enjoyment of our present surrounds, we join in saying that we find here the same spirit that prevailed in &rsquo;61 &mdash; the purpose and spirit to give us the best at their command.

			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. EDITOR: &mdash; Will you permit an old patron to say in your issued that the CITIZEN found it&rsquo;s way to our humble dwelling nearly from its birth, and was always received gratefully? To the retiring editor such complimentary notice of the able management of said paper is no doubt gratifying.
			</p>
			<p>
				But though well done, yet there is something painfully pleasing in the necessity to retire, life&rsquo;s labor being over because of want of ability to perform. The closing of a great enterprise is interesting. When Washington disbanded his military companions, the warrior became a child as he bid adieu to his men in soiled garments, and they all wept as children.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dekalb, the noble Frenchman, accepted a captaincy under Arnold, the traitor, and he cautioned his (Arnold&rsquo;s) imprudence in over marching his men, and was charged by Arnold with cowardice. Dekalb retorted by saying it would be seen who would be a coward. He dismounted his horse, met the enemy at the front of his men, lost his life, and was buried at Camden. Washington, on looking at the grave said, while tears furrowed down his cheeks, Here lies the generous stranger who came to fight our country&rsquo;s battles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although brought to this country among the Indians and denied the advantages of an education, yet my contributions to the CITIZEN were so corrected as to become readable, I believe. I wish to say of William and Frank Brand, one dead, the other living &mdash; how many times I have been delighted by their genial faces as I met them in their offices as editors. I feel a regard for Frank next to my own family, and feel a deep interest in his future.
			</p>
			<p>
				What will be the character of our admirable CITIZEN in the future? Will the same sagacity and moral tone characterize its future? May we feel prompted by the poor boys of the army that inspired the courage expressed in the song, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rally round the flag, boys?&rdquo; May success be heralded along the lines of the future of the old CITIZEN!
			</p>
			<p>
				Though older than my friend Saxton, I am compelled to lay off life&rsquo;s heavy toil. We bid each other adieu in our passed relation. Let us bear our individual conditions as cheerfully as we c an, hoping to greet each other many times this side of the river.

Mr. Todd Keller was a quaint, genial personality and had an army of friends. His death will be universally regretted. He was prominent in Grand Army, Church, and political circles and his friends, especially the companions of his life as a soldier, will deplore his unexpected and sudden demise. His death was preceded by that of Mr. Fuller and followed by that of Mrs. W. R. Ross. These afflictions cover the community as with a shroud and are portentous reminders of the uncertainties of human life. Our sympathies are with the bereaved households.

				<b>A &ldquo;PARTY&rdquo;</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				A party for our very tiny society men was given at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Patrick, Friday afternoon when Master Harold Patrick was host to a dozen of his friends. Harold was celebrating his fifth birthday, and shared the good times and the good things to eat, which the anniversary brought, with &ldquo;the boys.&rdquo; The children who went to the party were: Richard Brand, Reynolds Ross, Donald hunter, Harold Nichols, Warren Sullivan, Lee Dimond, Helen Patrick, Robert Patrick, John Mosgrove, Robert Hearn and the little brother of Master Harold&rsquo;s Edward Patrick. Pretty birthday gifts were brought, and every one had a merry afternoon at the birthday party.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Fully three hundred</b> shouting exultant people were at the Pennsylvania depot Friday afternoon at four o&rsquo;clock word having been received during the day that President Roosevelt and his party would pass through the city in a special train at that hour. The train was due to leave Columbus at 3:05 and was scheduled to arrive in this city at 3:37. It was running on schedule time at the second section of No. 7 and just to the minute the train came whistling down through the yards under a full head of steam. At the Ward street crossing a party of eleven children, Harold Patrick&rsquo;s birthday guests, were waiving and the President appeared and waved to them, the children responding with hurrahs. The President then reentered his train but it was not more than a minute until he came out again.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the train neared the crowd at the Pennsylvania depot the President was seen wending his way from the interior of the car to the rear platform. He was soon in full view and then the enthusiasm of those present could be restrained no longer and cheer after cheer rent the air. Democrats vied with Republicans in the demonstration and it was not a few who walked away from the depot with sore throats.
			</p>
			<p>
				The President was attired in black cutaway coat and wore gray trousers. He assumed that attitude, left hand in his trousers pocket, which is characteristic of him. Wit his right had he waved to the crowd until the train rounded the curve west of the depot. One great, broad smile covered his face and it never left while he was in sight. He was evidently pleased with the outpouring of citizens.
			</p>
			<p>
				The train was in charge of Conductor Johnson and Engineer Frost while Road master of Engines John Pontius of the Pennsylvania, was sitting on the fireman&rsquo;s seat pulling the bell rope. The train was made up of one baggage car, a diner, two sleepers and a parlor car, the latter in the rear with an observation apartment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those in the party with the President were Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Alice Roosevelt, Mr. and Mrs. Douglass Robins, Secretary, and Mrs. Loeb, Surgeon General Rixey, of the Navy, M.O. Latta, of the executive office and several representatives of the press associations.

				So gay and giddy are the older ladies of our community becoming, that one of their festive occasions is reported each week. They seem to have a better time at their parties than the younger people do, at least they have more to tell us, and are more pleased at the prospect, and more interested in the retrospect than their own grandchildren would be. It may be that they have lived long enough to know that social giving and taking may be made of one of the best things in life if entered into with the right spirit. And so, we are not surprised to hear of the very pleasant afternoon, which Mrs. John R. Ross arranged for some of her mother&rsquo;s friends to enjoy, last Tuesday. It was called a widow&rsquo;s party, and almost everyone of the thirty women present was a widow. Mrs. Spain and Mrs. Ross, received their guests with their usual cordiality, and the home radiated its air of good cheer, and everyone was made to realize the best of good times. Sweet smelling posies brightened the rooms and when the afternoon luncheon was served, ten of the older women were seated together at a long table. These were Mrs. Rhodes, Mrs. Chance, Mrs. Hubbell, Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Hitt, Mrs. Ellis, Mrs. Hovey, Mrs. Rinz (?), and Mrs. Spain. Little Reynolds Ross was the only man present, and he very gallantly and gracefully handed the ladies the tiny flags which were given as souvenirs.

Flinch proved an agreeable pastime and the several tables had a merry time at the progressive form of the game.

				<b>In 1825 the legislature</b> passed an act authorizing Judge John Reynolds of Urbana to drain Dugan Prairie, which he accomplished in a short time at great expense and by this means became the benefactor of around. The people in that neighborhood have suffered but little with fever and ague since then, though it occurred every summer previous to that time. When emigrants from the old state began to settle and make improvements around him, and Pere could see the light of the other fires in the &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; at night, and hear the sound of the woodman&rsquo;s axe and maul by day, he concluded it was time for him to hunt a new home as game was getting somewhat scarce. He accordingly packed up his traps and accompanied by his wife, children and dogs, he wended his way to the north and located near the head of Scioto river, where he ended his days. It was his custom after he left here to visit Urbana at least once a year, to dispose of his furs and skins, and as Judge Reynolds had become the owner of his old home, he always expected him to pay some rent, which was cheerfully done, and a pound of &ldquo;pigtail&rdquo; tobacco or a calico dress pattern for his youngest papoose was usually given by the Judge, and thankfully received by Pere and ample satisfaction. Many amusing anecdotes of Dugan were related by the early settlers who knew him, one of which I will give:
			</p>
			<p>
				He once purchased a bag of cornmeal from John Taylor, at his mill on King&rsquo;s Creek, and as he had no horse of his own, Mr. Taylor kindly offered him the use of one to carry his meal home. The horse was a small one named Gopher. Pere thankfully accepted the offer, and after taking an earnest look, first at gopher, then at the bag of meal, then at himself, he concluded that it would be impossible for the horse to carry both him and the bag of meal, and being impressed with the belief that &ldquo;a merciful man will be merciful to his beast,&rdquo; he took the gag of meal upon his own shoulder and deliberated leading Gopher back to a stump, he mounted his bare back, saying as he did so that &ldquo;he could carry the bag of mean and the horse could carry him.&rdquo; And in this way he rode home.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>THE PATRIOTIC REYNOLDS</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				And in this connection one other individual deserves to be noticed, for the valuable services he bestowed during all the war, in aiding the government by advancements of money and means when her treasury was greatly depleted and waited to the return for such advancement until she was able to refund: he was actuated in his course entirely through patriotism as a private individual, not as a public functionary: many poor destitute soldiers would have had to have gone into winter service destitute of blankets and other indispensable articles promotive of comfort, had it not been for the kind interposition of his patriotic soul. John Reynolds was the man whose acts I have attempted to describe. Mr. Reynolds well deserves this tribute, and aside from those acts. Urbana owes him a debt of gravitated for his devotion to her interests during a long life of usefulness: he indeed contributed greatly in building up the interest of both town and country, and his name should be cherished in Urbana as a household souvenir.

			</p>
			<p>
				At the Grace church one of the best numbers on the program was a recitation rendered by four little fellows, Harold Patrick, Robert Patrick, Reynolds Ross and Maynard Sullivan. This number turned out to be more like a comedy quartette and made an immense hit with those present.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the Presbyterian church the anthems rendered were one of the features of the program. The work of the Boys&rsquo; Brigade was also wee received.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the other churches of the city interesting programs of song and recitations were given by the children and older members of the Sunday schools. (Handwritten &ndash; 1905)

				<b>At the High School &mdash; Longfellow&rsquo;s Birthday</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have grown accustomed to expect from the pupils of our High school faultless execution of whatever they undertake. The management of the school is so excellent, and the work done there so efficient, and yet we were impressed yesterday with what we must term the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of the entertainment. While all their publics are superior, certainly the character of this last poet&rsquo;s hour marks it even higher than any before given.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tone and bearing of the school was very impressive. The perfect deportment of the pupils &mdash; no restlessness &mdash; a deportment their elders may well emulate &mdash; their respectful and interested attention &mdash; the appreciation of the high sentiments of our poet manifested in their attentive faces &mdash; their evident sympathetic enjoyment of the success of their friends on duty &mdash; in short, the spirit of the school was so in accord with the spirit of the hour, that is clearly demonstrated to all present that our young people are securing from their school many things not put down in books &mdash; advantages that only the best instructors and most cultured scholarship and associations can impart.
			</p>
			<p>
				The room was tastefully decorated with pictures and flowers. The blackboards displayed choice quotations from Longfellow, and the program of the afternoon. Part of the decorations of the boards was the handiwork of Miss Maggie Stone and Messrs Ross and Heiserman. Over a portrait of Longfellow two palm leaves were crossed and tied with the National colors, and beneath it, on a pedestal was a beautiful vase filled with calla lilies and ferns.
			</p>
			<p>
				A pleasant feature of the entertainment was the return of the alumni to add their tribute to the &ldquo;Sweetest of all Singers.&rdquo; Mrs. Max Ross sang &ldquo;The Day is Done.&rdquo; In excellent voice and with great feeling. Miss Louise Stone carried her audience with her in her tender rendition of &ldquo;Sandalphon.&rdquo; Love for Alma Mater must have inspired these ladies of the alumni, and we are sure no school better deserves the love of all its pupils, past and present.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is impossible to speak of individual effort where all was perfect of its kind. Such prompt, flawless execution of the program, with no signal or interference of any kind by the teachers, we never saw but once before, and that was in the same room two years ago, at the Shakespeare hour.
			</p>
			<p>
				We would like to go over the program piece by piece and tell the honestly deserved praises and merits of each one, but had we time they must have been heard to form an adequated idea of their excellence. The distinct enunciation, correct pronunciation and easy gesticulation, were evidences of unusually careful training, the work of Miss Friend, who has charge of the department of elocution.
			</p>
			<p>
				We congratulate the school on its success, and assure them that we came away impressed, as by the poet&rsquo;s very presence, with the sweetness and beauty of the hour.

				<b>KINDERGARTNERS IN FESTAL ARRAY</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>A Merger Birthday Banquet at The Den Yesterday Afternoon</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The must scrumptious banquet that ever happened in Phoenix was held at &ldquo;The Den&rdquo; late yesterday afternoon and was a cooperative birthday party of Miss Ellis&rsquo; kindergartners. It all happened this way. John Irvine, one of the youngsters as arranging to celebrate his anniversary and two or three others were dated for similar events almost at the same time. It was therefore decided to hold a general school celebration with a joint party for all the little folks who have birthdays during the months of April and May. That included the following list: Alice Christy, aged 3, Dean Wattawa, aged 5, John Harding Irvine, aged 6, Floy Watson, aged 6, Paul Willis aged 8, Marcella Johnson, aged 10, Bessie Thomas, aged 12, and Georjeane Barnes, who was six years old yesterday.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such a fine lot of birthdays could not be properly celebrated in any ordinary way. There is no finer place to celebrate anybody&rsquo;s birthday than at the Den and as that is the home of little Georjeane Barnes that palatial resort was elected as the festal scene for the children. The long handsomely furnished hall was set for the banquet so there was no interference with the plans of the hungry grown folks who dropped in as usual at the dinner hour. The banquet table was laid for the following guests, a few interested parents being present to &ldquo;wait table&rsquo; and superintend ceremonies:
			</p>
			<p>
				William Kinnon, Louise Kinnon, William Christy, Alice Christy, Jane Christy, Rosalind Williamson, Virginia Kerr, Laura Kerr, Beryl Kelly, Mildred Hayes, Catherine Hart, Dean Wattawa, Garner Wilson, Grace Tharaldson, Edwin Schupp, Burt Friedman, Georjeane Barnes, Harold Kyle, John Irvine, Luella Campbell, Floy Watson, Catherine Easterling, Ruth Ambrose, Mary Hulett, Marcella Johnson, Reynolds Ross, Marche Johnson, Marsh Smith; Paul Willis, Mildred Doris, Kitty Craig, Alice Zimmerman, Harriett Tritle, Marion Bennett, Isabel Irvine, Lewis Irvine, John Irvine, Mrs. Hansel, Miss Thomas and Miss Ellis.
			</p>
			<p>
				The table itself was novel and presented a fairy scene. One end of it, where the great big children sat, was about half as high as an ordinary table and from there it tapered down to the height of about 18 inches, where the three year olds were placed. It was decorated with colored candelabra, roses, sweet peas, daisies, poppies, marigolds, and other flowers from the garden of the kindergartners. The electric lights were shaded with peeper boughs and the table was burdened with sandwiches, cakes, ice cream, and all the sweet meats the youngsters like and gallons of pure sweet milk were furnished in lieu of the things the big folks drink at their banquets. There was also a birthday cake for each youngster who could crowd his birthday anniversary into April or May, and one more. That was for Miss Ellis, the teacher. The children insisted that she have a birthday too, and they all voted that she was sweet sixteen, so they put sixteen candles on her cake, each of the others being illuminated in a similar way, in accordance with the number of years they had torn of the calendar. Instead of toasts each of the nine honorary guests were honored with hand clapping as their names were called, each being given as many ovations as he or she had years to his or her credit, and one to grow on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fond parents began arriving about the time the celebration was over, and after their pictures had be taken in a group, to take their children home, and the children departed in a more gleeful frame of mind that their elders usually do after more expensive and spectacular but less impressive ceremonials.

				The news of Mr. Ross&rsquo;s death, while not unexpected, will come a great shock to his many friends in this city who have inquired constantly for work from Phoenix hoping all the while that that word might be to the effect that the climate there was having the desired effect on his health. The word never came but instead the word was always to the effect that conditions were not a promising as Mr. Ross and his family had hoped for. However, the first intimation that he was dangerously ill came in the form of a telegram received Monday evening at the supper hour. The word received then was the Mr. Ross was very sick. This message was followed by another which reached this city this morning at four o&rsquo;clock and which told of Mr. Ross&rsquo; death which occurred at to o&rsquo;clock Monday evening.

				<b>An Urbana Boy.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				John R. Ross was born and reared in this city, and lived here all of his life with the exception of a short period spent in St. Louis and the last year and a half spent in Arizona and Los Angeles, Cal. He was 4 years of age on the 21<sup>st</sup> of last April and is survived by his wife and one son, Reynolds, aged nine years, and his father, W. R. Ross, of this city.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following his course of training in the Urbana public schools he entered the Champaign National Bank as a bookkeeper and held that position until he resigned to go into the electrical business which took him to St. Louis for a short period. He soon returned to this city and continued to make Urbana his home until failing health compelled him to go south. He was employed for several years previous to his leaving the city in the office of the Urbana Egg Case Company. It was in the spring of 1907 that his health failed so much because of tuberculosis that he was compelled to give up active employment and seek a milder and dryer climate. He went to Phoenix in the spring of 1907, but that summer he spent in Los Angeles and in September of the same year he visited his home in this city for a short period. He remained in Phoenix until this spring when he went back to Los Angeles and remained there until a week ago when the return trip to Phoenix was made. the family was en route gave the relatives her the impression that he was standing the trip well but he didn&rsquo;t. He became very much worse upon his arrival in Phoenix and his strength was too far gone to longer resist the ravages of the disease, which had been slowly but surely wearing him away.
			</p>
			<p>
				The decedent was one of the city&rsquo;s best know young men and previous to his health failing he was prominent in church and musicale circles. He was at one time a warden it the Church of the Epiphany and his excellent bass voice had much to do with creating the excellent standard of music heard there. He also belonged to Harmony Lodge No. 8, F. and A.M. and other higher bodies, being a Scottish Rite Mason. He was married in September 1893 to Miss Lydia Spain, who has been faithful and constant in her ministrations to him. Mrs. Spain was also with him during the early part of his stay in the southwest bus she is at present at the home of her sisters in Geauga county.
			</p>
			<p>
				The news of Mr. Ross&rsquo;s death while not unexpected will bring sorrow to many people in this city as he was strong in his friendships and possessed a personality and a good fellowship that won and held him many friends. His wife and little son and his father will have the sympathy of all of these in the hour of their deep affliction.

				<b>MRS. LAVINIA BRAND PASSES GENTLE TO THE GREAT BEYOND</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Something of the Remarkable Life of One of Our Mothers Which Has Just Closed.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Another mother of a city and a home passed gently to her rest Thursday afternoon when Mrs. Lavinia Brand gave an indomitable spirit into her Maker&rsquo;s hands. She was surrounded by children, grandchildren and great grandchildren during the last hours of her life and her daughters&rsquo; loving care for her was only equaled by her though for them, her word of thanks for each service rendered.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Brand has suffered from asthma during fifty hears of her life, and a severe attach of this disease several days ago was followed by a dread weakness, showing to the members of her family that she would not linger, with them much longer. Those whose homes are not in Urbana were called here and it gave the mother great happiness to recognize her son J. C. Brand an his wife, of Bellefontaine, and later Rev. and Mrs. E. D. Whitlock of Fostoria, Mrs. Whitlock arriving in time to help to make the going away as easy as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Brand&rsquo;s home for the eight years since her husband&rsquo;s death has been with the family of her daughter, Mrs. C.A. Ross, and devoted care made the last years of her life peaceful and happy &mdash; the more so that they were spent in the old homestead where her own children grew to maturity. For seventy-five years Mrs. Lavinia Brand has been connected with Urbana&rsquo;s life, taking a decided stand upon any moral question: true to her convictions and intense in her views, yet modest in expression. In 1861 her heroic spirit showed the patriot&rsquo;s fire, and she gave a mothers blessing and prayers to the husband and sons who marched away to defend the stars and stripes. And those sons who went to the battlefield knew that ifthey did not come back their mother gave them with tears, it may be but with pride to their country.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Industry her Motto.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Rand was also active in the Crusade movement here in 1874, and has always believed in total abstinence form the use of intoxicants and abetted any movement towards temperance reform.
			</p>
			<p>
				She was devoted to her church home, Grace Methodist Episcopal and almost her last words were: &ldquo;The Lord has led me for eighty-one years, and has been so good to me.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as far as human strength would allow she obeyed the injunction to &ldquo;Be ye perfect even as I am perfect.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				But although connected with every good work of city and church and enjoying the best of the social life it was in the home that Mrs. Brand ruled a realm. She was the mother of nine children, she worked for them with hands and head and heart. In the latter days of her life she delighted to tell how she had &ldquo;made the carpet for the front room ins spare moments and had enough left for the dining room.&rdquo; Her boys tell how she made their shoes and caps, knitted stockings and mittens, made their trousers and shirts. Her hands were never idle, and even when age made the slight fingers tremble, they still held the needle she worked for grand children and great grandchildren to the end, and no one could make such button holes as grandmother. That is a picture which will always be her grandchildren&rsquo;s recollection of her &mdash; a frail little woman, always busy and cheerful, with a glad welcome for each of her own as they visited her.

				Lavinia Talbott was born April 5, 1813, in Newtown, Virginia, and her death occurring Nov. 2, 1905, she was in her ninety-third year. She was the daughter of Rev. John and Margaret Talbott, and after her mother&rsquo;s death when she was nine years old, she lived with her grandparents in Shepherdstown, Virginia. In 1832 she came to Urbana to visit an aunt and here she met Mr. Joseph C. Brand, and they were married July 4<sup>th</sup> of that same year. Nine children were born to them, five of whom are living: Thomas Talbott Brand, Sr., Joseph Coulson Brand, Mary Lavinia Whitlock, John Francis Brand, and Ella Brand Ross. The deceased are Ellen and Ivva Brand, William A. Brand and Belle Brand Ross.

				<b>Read by Rev. C. C. Kennedy Following Episcopal Church Ritual---Interment Made at Oak Dale</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The burial service of the Episcopal Church was used at the funeral of C.A. Ross, this afternoon, when many friends gathered at the home to pay their tribute of love and respect to the memory of Mr. Ross. Rev. C.C. Kennedy was in charge of the service and in addition to the words of the ritual, read a memoir of the deceased, and the words of &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Wideness in God&rsquo;s Mercy,&rdquo; and led in prayer .
			</p>
			<p>
				Following is the memoir read which was written by W. R. Ross:
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The fondness of our friend in his earlier and even later years for the services of the Episcopal Church and its sublime ritual, together with his unfondness for any public mention of himself would render the impersonal service of the Church for the dead, peculiarly grateful to him and any extended memoir at this time very ungrateful to him. Although a jovial and hearty disposition was pronouncedly a man of deeds rather than words.

				Charles Alanson Ross lived his life in Urbana. He was born December 2, 1849, and died August 4, 1914, being in his 65<sup>th</sup> year. He was married on June 25, 1872 to Ella Brand, daughter of the late Hon. Joseph C. and Lavinia Brand. To them were born three children. Mrs. Ivva Ross Arnold, wife of Fred W. Arnold, of Bellefontaine, Ohio; Charles A. Ross, Jr. and Coleman B. Ross, both of this city, who all survive him as do the grandchildren, Charles Lester Arnold, Julia Slater Ross, and William Ring Ross.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Mr. Ross&rsquo;s predication for an occupation in life was early developed for bookkeeping, and his beautiful penmanship, with his business acumen, made him valuable and sought after in the store and office and bank. In the later years of his life he was the successful head of the veteran Western Mutual Fire Insurance Company of our city, doing business all over the state of Ohio. In this, as in everything he was prompt, exact, energetic and fair.
			</p>
			<p>
				The son of Philander B. and Julia Slater Ross, he could hardly be other than religious. Although religion is not transmitted, the examples of such lives of devotion to God, and reverence for and attendance upon his Church, and their generous support of the same could not be influence and bind him. He was for the greater part of his life a member of Grace Methodist Episcopal Church and for years and at the time of his death an office bearer.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the community he was public spirited and instead of spending his life exclusively in laying penny upon penny, he always assumed his share of the public burdens. This was early developed in him when as a boy of fourteen, the call of the larger community, our country in peril, made him the drummer boy of the army, and we may add that at 64, the martial spirit was still strong and he marched with the drum corps on occasions of the reunion of his regiment, the 134<sup>th</sup> Ohio, and at other patriotic gatherings.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his family, Mr. Ross as the loving husband and devoted father, and even to his grandchildren they are disconsolate at this death. What more can we say of any man than that he has so grandly filled his human life; rounded out his earthly career and now has been promoted we may well imagine into an existence which earthly eye has never seen and whose glories our minds can never conceive until released from the flesh; and while we mourn he rejoices in the joy of his lord.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Interment was made at Oak Dale Cemetery, six nephews of Mr. Ross acting as pall-bearers, they being: Calvin B. Ross, of Cleveland, Albert W. Ross, of Indianapolis, Frank Talbott of Springfield; Dr. F. W. Brand, Charles Brand, and William G. Whitlock, of Lakewood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Relatives here to attend the funeral today are: Mrs. Nelson Caldwell and Miss Jennie Hall, of Cincinnati; Calvin B. Ross, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. G. Whitlock, Dr. Frank E. Whitlock, of Cleveland; John P. Brand, of Chicago; Dr. and Mrs. Frank W. Brand, Mr. and Mrs. Garnett W. Brand and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Talbott, of Springfield; G. A. Talbott of Akron; Mr. and Mrs. Albert W. Ross of Indianapolis.

				<b>PASSES AWAY IN THE DEATH OF WILLIAM ROSS</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>OF HIGH TYPE OF MANHOOD</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Distinguished For Christian Character, Financial Integrity, Broad Charity And Local Civic Interest</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				When William R. Ross passed away at 8 o&rsquo;clock this morning, Urbana lost on of its distinguished citizens &mdash; distinguished for his Christian character, financial integrity, patriotism, broad charity and local civic interest. He has long been recognized in the community as the highest type of manhood, a leader in church work, a liberal supporter of every effort for moral, social, and civic improvements, kindly interest especially in young men, straightforward in business and conscientious in the discharge of every duty. Particularly modes in his estimate of his own qualifications he never sought advancement or recognition, but was strong in support of friends and of any man who represented sound principles and uprightness. He never held a political office, yet has belonged to the community, the friend and counselor of all classes, universally known and spoken of as a good man. Gentle, modes, firm, he always stood for the highest ideals of citizenship.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Ross was born in Urbana May 7, 1841, and has spent his entire life in this city with the exception of nearly three years service in the army during the civil war, a few months each, Madison, Wis., and Nashville, Tenn. He was educated in the public schools of Urbana and afterwards by close application acquired a wide knowledge of literature and was an authority on literary construction.
			</p>
			<p>
				In September, 1861, with fervent patriotic zeal, he enlisted as a member of Company A, 66<sup>th</sup> regiment O.V. I, and in January 1862 went to the front with his regiment sharing in the honorable and strenuous history of that organization until 1864, when he was discharged on account of disability. He served as Quarter Master Sergeant of his regiment during the greater part of his army life and failed of higher military rank through his modest estimate of his own fitness. He was tendered the position of Adjutant and declined because he feared his inability to measure up in military tactics. After his discharge from the army he served for a few months as chief clerk in the office of Major T. T. Brand, mustering and disbursing officer at Madison, Wis., and later as bookkeeper in a bank at Nashville, Tenn. In the fall of 1865, upon the organization of the Champaign National bank, he was called to his old home to accept a position as bookkeeper. The balance of his business life has been given to the interests of this institution having served successively as teller, cashier, vice president,; his last service being in the latter position. During his fifty years&rsquo; connection, his ability and banking knowledge have been generally recognized and his kindly presence and counsel will be sadly missed by his late associates. He has served as President of the Western Mutual Fire Insurance company for almost twenty-six years.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1866 he was united in marriage with Miss Belle Brand and they erected a home that was characterized by genial hospitality for twenty seven years, when Mrs. Ross died in September 1893. They had one son, John R. Ross, who was well known in the community as teller of the Champaign National bank and died in 1908. His only living descendent is a grandson, Reynolds Ross, whose home is with his mother Mrs. Lydia Ross, of West Church street.
			</p>
			<p>
				July 11, 1898, he was united in marriage a second time with Ellen Taylor and she has been permitted to comfort his declining years and to care for him in his last days.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his boyhood he united with the Second M.E. church, later known as Grace church. For more than forty years he has been an official of this church, served from many years as Superintendent of the Sunday School and was a most acceptable director of the music. His clear, bell-like voice was an inspiration to the congregations, and his devotion and liberality have been an example to all of the membership. Aside from his own family nothing was dearer to his heart than Grace church.
			</p>
			<p>
				Funeral services will be held from his late residence on South Main street, Monday morning at 10 o&rsquo;clock.

				<b>FRIDAY MORNING, DEMEMBER 29, 1911</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. W. R. Ross and Mrs. Lydia Ross entertained a company of their friends Thursday afternoon with one of the most enjoyable receptions ever given in Urbana. There were two hours for the party, which was held at the home of the younger Mrs. Ross, and the ladies were coming and going all afternoon, and very much regretting that they must depart, so great was their pleasure. The home had been prepared for the company with holiday decorations of green and red, and candle light was used in all the rooms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mesdames Ross after greeting their guests invited them to the music room, where they met Miss Anna Allison Jones, of Chicago. Miss Jones is a former Zanesville girl was a singer of remarkable talent, who has won recognition for herself in Chicago, and contemplates going to New York in the near future. She now has a studio in Chicago, and devotes most of her time to concert work, although she has a number of pupils. Miss Jones is the soloist at the Jewish Synagogue at Chicago, singing there Friday evening and Saturday morning of each week., and has similar engagements at the large Congregationalist church for Sunday morning and evening.
			</p>
			<p>
				Surely Urbana women were fortunate in hearing such a singer and they expressed their pleasure by work and action. The musicale was informal, the guests standing and Miss Jones singing several times, and being given an opportunity to meet the Urbana ladies between the numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The program was varied, beginning with a German Song, &ldquo;Das Krau Vergessenhelt&rdquo; (Hildach), which was a good introduction for the singer&rsquo;s lovely contralto voice. Miss Jones&rsquo; voice is one in a thousand, very low pitched, but rich and rare. She does not attempt to take the high notes, but as great volume and tones that are bell-like, clear and strong. She sang a &ldquo;Splendid Rose&rdquo; song for her second number, &ldquo;A Memory&rdquo; (Edna Rosalind Park), and her singing of it will be a &ldquo;memory.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Boat Song,&rdquo; by Harriet Ware, (words by Montrose J. Moses), was bright, vivacious, summery. &ldquo;From the Land of the Sky Blue Water&rdquo; (Charles Wakefield Cadman), with words by Nelle Richmond Eberhart, was exquisitely beautiful, and &ldquo;A Disappointment,&rdquo; by Helen Hood was another.
			</p>
			<p>
				The child&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;If I Were a Little Child Again,&rdquo; (Clayton Thomas) was &ldquo;just dear,&rdquo; and Miss Jones&rsquo; expression added to her singing of this number even more than the others, although her personality had much to do with her success. &ldquo;I Hid My Love&rdquo; (Guy D&rsquo;Hardelot), and &ldquo;No Candle Was There, and No Fire&rdquo; (Breton fold song), by Liza Lehmann, were two numbers heard by the first company and omitted in the second program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mrs. Joe N. Hitt was at the piano, and her skillful accompaniment was a great assistance to the singer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following the musicale a dozen of the good friends and relatives of the hostesses served a salad course to the guests, as they enjoyed an informal mingling and conversation. (Handwritten: Bess Brand)

This reception practically closes the social season for this year and in a way ushers in the new season of social activity.

Miss Jones has a studio in Chicago and soloist at the Jewish Synagogue and also at a large Congregational church in that city.

				Her program was varied and the selections were beautiful. &ldquo;Das Kraut Vergssenheit,&rdquo; by Hildach, opened the program. &ldquo;A Splendid Rose,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Memory,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Boat Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Summer&rsquo;s in the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;From the Land of Sky Blue Water,&rdquo; &ldquo;A disappointment,&rdquo; &ldquo;If I were a Little Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Hid My Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Candle was There and No Fire.&rdquo; Each of these beautiful selections brought out new qualities in Miss Jones&rsquo; voice and gave her opportunities of expressing a charming personality. Mrs. Joe Hitt skillfully assisted at the piano. A salad course was served the guests before departure.

			</p>
			<p>
				A most beautiful and estimable life can to a close Monday evening around 7:30 o&rsquo;clock, when J. F. Brand passed quietly away at his home on West Reynolds street. Saturday nigh Mr. Brand suffered a hemorrhage of the lungs and as the days passed he grew rapidly worse until death finally relieved is sufferings. He has been in failing health for the past several years, but never uttered a complaint and it was only his indomitable will that kept him from being bedfast.
			</p>
			<p>
				John Francis Brand, better know as &ldquo;Frank or &ldquo;J. F. Brand,&rdquo; died at his home on West Reynolds street, Urbana, Ohio, Monday, October 13, 1919 at 6:30 p.m., after a short but severe illness. Thus passed a life long resident of this County, a splendid business man and excellent citizen.
			</p>
			<p>
				J. F. Brand was born June 18, 1848 in Union Township this county, being the youngest son of Major Joseph C. and Lavinia Talbott Brand. He received his education in the public schools of Urbana and Urbana University. At the age of 15 years he was employed as assistant engineer in the construction of the Atlantic and Great Western Rail Road, now the Erie railroad, and as such helped in surveying the right of way and establishing the grades of that road for 15 miles east of north Lewisburg. In 1864 he became clerk to his father in the Commissary department of the United States Army and served in that capacity until the close of the War between the States, being present at Lee&rsquo;s surrender at Appomattox and assisting in execution of Grant&rsquo;s order to feed the hungry confederates. At the age of 19 he accepted employment with the Urbana Citizen and Gazette, and in 10 years rose through the several grades of reporter, local editor, and business manager of that influential paper. Engaging in business for himself he chose the grocer trade and operated retail stores in Urbana and Bellefontaine. Afterwards in conjunction with the late W. H. Marvin he organized the company known as the W. H. Marvin Co. which was engaged in the whole sale grocery business in Urbana and later became the pioneer operators in the preparation and distribution of dried fruits and other food products.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1905 he turned over his active duties in that company to his sons, in succession, and became general agent of the Western Mutual Fire Insurance Company, becoming afterward treasurer and president of that Company. At the same time he became actively identified with other of our representative institutions, being at the time of his death, President and Treasurer of the Western Mutual Fire Insurance Company, President of the McCoy Canning Co., Vice President of the Champaign National Bank and director of the W. H. Marvin Co. and in the Urbana Telephone Company.
			</p>
			<p>
				During his active business life he did not neglect his religious and social development. He was a life long member of the official board for 35 years. In Masonry he was a member of the Lodge, Chapter, Council, Commandery and Scottish Rite, and has been Master of Harmony Lodge and Em Commander of Raper Commandery. He served efficiently on the Committee which secured plans and erected the Masonic Temple
			</p>
			<p>
				December 1, 1870, Mr. Brand was married to Fannie E. Patrick, a daughter of Evan B. Patrick, late of this city. To this union have been born four children, Charles and Joseph E., well know business men of Urbana, Elizabeth a teacher of the deaf in Pittsburg, Pa., and Ella, wife of Col. Guy L. Qualis, U. S. Army, and now a resident of Colon, Canal Zone, Panama.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus are sketched some of the nonsaliant facts of the life of this good man and exemplary citizen; but they come far short of portraying the grace of his presence, the courtesy of his demeanor, the friendliness of his spirit, his devotion to truth and honor and many other excellent traits of character which will ennoble his memory to those who knew him best.
			</p>
			<p>
				His was a well balance development of all his faculties and powers. His culture was broad and enlightened. His ideals were high and noble. His optimism superb and engaing. He was a very companionable man and had friends among men of all ages. Indeed he was a lover of men, for their own sake, with a great charity of though for all their short comings. In short he was a Christian gentleman, a fine flower of our Western civilization. Funeral services will be held from the late home, Wednesday afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock, when a Scottish Rite service will be held. Reverend J. P. Simmonds, pastor of the Grace M. E. church will officiate assisted by Dr. Frank Mitchell, Interment will be made at Oak Dale cemetery. One daughter Mrs. Ella Brand Qualls, will be unable to be in attendance at the funeral owing____that the she together_____(note: missing end of article)

				About two-twenty o&rsquo;clock Saturday afternoon an airplane flying a great height and traveling rapidly passed over Urbana, going east. Because the weather conditions ware such as they are, it is not thought probably that it was someone testing a plane or anything of the kind, so the supposition is that it was the U.

A dispatch bearing on the condition is carried in another column of this issue.

				By special invitation of the entertainment committee the members of the club appeared in quaint and fancy costumes and it seemed lie a veritable panorama of the different periods of the last hundred years. The fashions of long ago called to mind by many carefully preserved &ldquo;attic treasures&rdquo; caused great amusement. Elegant wedding gowns prevailed an by their reappearance after long repose in cedar chests, recalled many beautiful scenes where pretty young brides were the central figures and some ventured to remark that the stately dames with the dignity and grace of mature years added new lute to the way satin folds and made more precious the costly heirlooms of dainty lace.

Part of the way from choice she rode horseback, although she is eighty-three years old. She is the mother of ten children-five boys and five girls &mdash; the oldest born in &rsquo;40. Five of them are living. She is fond of horseback riding, although she has done little of it in recent years, having no horse handy. An ambition which she expects to satisfy is to go on horseback on a extended trip to Kentucky among her relatives and friends. She brought her knitting with her.

				Charles Alanson Ross was born Dec 2, 1849, on Locust Street, between Scioto and Court Streets in Urbana; his life was lived almost entirely in our city; and his death caused by hardening of the arteries, occurring at 7:30 o&rsquo;clock this morning at the family home on West Reynolds Street. He was a member of a family very closely identified with the early history of Urbana, the son of P. B. and Julia A. Ross and in every way worthy of strong forebears, W. R. Ross and Mrs. Anna Ross Davies of Chicago are the survivors of a large family of brothers and sisters.
			</p>
			<p>
				He was a boy in wartimes and when the 134<sup>th</sup> Regiment went to the front, Mr. Ross, a boy of 14, went with them as a drummer. They were &ldquo;the boys,&rdquo; the older men had gone earlier, but Charles Ross was the youngest of the regiment. His affiliation with the G.A.R. in later years was a prized association of his life.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a young man, he was bookkeeper for Shillito&rsquo;s(?) in Cincinnati; later he was assistant cashier of the Third National Bank of Urbana, and afterward held the same position with the Champaign National Bank and during those years he served as City Clerk of Urbana. For several years Mr. Ross was Special Agent of the Home Insurance Company of New York, and thirteen years ago, he was elected Secretary and Treasure of the Western Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Urbana, which position he held at the time of his death.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Ross was a member of Grace Episcopal church which church his parents had helped to found and was a trustee of the church at the time of his death. He was a member of Harmony Lodge, No 8, F. and A.M.
			</p>
			<p>
				A conscientious businessman, staunch, true, and fearless in all his public life; with a vivid sense of humor, ready to relieve any tense situation and an innate sense of modesty which caused him to be notably reticent. He was a man who will be remembered by the community. But, another side of this character was revealed in his home to his family and close friends, the poetry of his nature made him beloved. Music and flowers and little children were his passions. On those rare times when he brought his drum out, that nature showed at his best; in one of his last conscious moments he asked Mrs. Ross to play &ldquo;the old hymn&rdquo; and she played &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Wideness&rdquo; at the piano and many of the old hymns were repeated by him in these last weeks of suffering when during his conscious moments he bore his burden of pain as cheerfully as he had all his life borne every burden.
			</p>
			<p>
				His marriage to his wife who was Ella Brand, on June 25, 1872, was a union blessed by three children, Ivva Ross Arnold, C.A. Ross, Jr. and Coleman B. Ross. They all survive the husband and father, and there are three grandchildren, Charles Arnold, Julia and William Ross. Their home life has been ideal he and his wife have been the truest companions and the home founded forty years ago is sadden by death for the first time when the father is taken.

				<b>Are the Two Great Men In Belgium Today Says Charles Maskens, Secretary to the Belgian Legation at Washington. In Interview with New York Herald Man</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The New York Herald several days ago carried the following letter from their Washington correspondent. The letter contains statements made by Charles Maskens, secretary of the Belgian legation, which are such wonderful words of praise for Mr. Brand Whitlock, that they are reprinted here that his friends in Urbana may rejoice that he is fulfilling it&rsquo;s great trust.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;An unusual Thanksgiving Day statement, expressing the deep gratitude of the stricken people of Belgium for the relief extended to them from the United States, was made by Charles Maskens, who has just assumed his duties in Washington as Secretary of the Belgian Legation.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My country as a nation is grateful,&rdquo; said Mr. Maskens; &ldquo;my King, in the trenches with his army, feels a gratitude he cannot express that his poor people are being saved by unknown hands across the sea; my fellowmen, having lost all that is dear to them, bless the unseen friends whose sympathy and benefactions are now double sweet.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;With more than seven millions of our people facing starvation, with many of them without shelter or clothing to protect them from a severe winter, we have been given proof that a spirit of Christian brotherhood is practiced by at least one nation. We have been saved by their charity expressed in practical form.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I venture to say that not another nation would or could do what Americans have at this time. Not only was the help large and prompt, as the occasion demands, but a way had to be found to get the succor into our country without being seized by our enemies. The representatives of the American government in Brussels opened the way, the only way that has been opened for feeding our people. We are dependent upon what Americans give us. Their big-heartedness will be written into our national history.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;When I tell you that there are two great men in Belgium today, King Albert and Brand Whitlock, the American Minister, it is not lessening in the least the homage we pay our sovereign, whom we love more than ever now in the great crisis of his reign. It is our way of telling you how truly we appreciate all that the American Minister has done for us that we place him next to our King.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;All over Belgium, from the recently wealthy and the poor alike, from our nobility and our refugees, from our diplomatic representatives, I heard the same glorifying words of tribute. Brand Whitlock is hailed throughout our land as the savior of the people. He opened a way for their relief when such a way seemed impossible, and he did it while preserving the strictest diplomacy. It was a greater act of humanity.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Besides saving our people from starvation, Americans by their ready sympathy &mdash; and it must have cost much self-denial to supply so much relief in so short a time &mdash; have given the Belgians a rebirth of hope of ambition and enterprise for the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;My people are grateful for the charity so readily shown and made effective through careful organization, but they are also ambitious for the day when they can again earn their own living. When the invaders have been driven from our land, my people hope to show the world a fine spirit of rehabilitation in that day of their expectation they are confident they will continue to hold the brotherliness that America is now so magnificently showing.

Quaint Dutch vases holding roses were centre pieces: there were Dutch pictures on the napkins and on the candy boxes, and each little guest had a whistling man as a favor. After refreshments were served, Reynolds Ross had a picture show, throwing reflections of post cards on a screen to the great delight of the infants.

				Mrs. Jennings in a few very earnest remarks state the petition of the Ladies&rsquo; League and presented an Ordinance for the suppression of Tippling houses, and to prohibit the keeping of Ale, Beer or Porter houses in the City, asking that the Council pass it and to assist them in their great work of moral reform.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Ordinance then passed its first reading, and Mr. Thompson moved the rules be suspended and the Ordinance placed upon its passage. The vote on the suspension stood: Yeas &mdash; Baldwin, Brand, Ganson, Thompson; Nays &mdash; McCarthy, Powers. So the motion was lost.

				Mr. Brand then moved that the Council now adjourn to meet at 7 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow (Tuesday). The motion was subsequently withdrawn.

				The Council then unanimously granted to the Ladies&rsquo; League, the use of City Hall, whenever they desired it.

				Mrs. West offered up a fervent and powerful prayer, asking Divine wisdom to guide the Council in the use of their legislative power, and beseeching the Almighty to direct their thoughts and actions so the intemperance may be speedily suppressed and Alcohol conquered.

				<b>Wilson Says the Opposition Will Be Thrown on High and Barren Shore.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Boston, Feb. 24 &mdash; President Wilson, in his first speech in American on returning from Europe, accepted the challenge of those who oppose American&rsquo;s entrance into a league of nations.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, he declared, &ldquo;I have no more doubt of the verdict of America in this matter than I have doubt of the blood that is in me.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have come back to report progress,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I did not believe that the progress is going to stop short of the goal.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The president&rsquo;s speck was the first direct answer to opponents of the league in the senate. It was planned to lay the background for American support of his program. Its preparation followed along conference on the George Washington with Secretary Tumulty.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It warms my hear,&rdquo; the president said in opening, &ldquo;to see my fellow-citizens again, because I have at times felt very lonely in recent weeks without your counsel.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The extraordinary generous reception given me on the other side seemed to be a call of greeting to you rather than to me. I had the crowning pride of being your representative. Men everywhere felt that your hearts beat with theirs in the cause of liberty.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The plaudits of the European crowds, he said, were calls to America for a union across the sea in a peace of justice and right.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The proudest thing I have to report to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; is that our great country is trusted throughout the world.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Faith in United States.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&rdquo;The settlement of this war affects every great nation, and sometimes I think every small nation in the world. No one decision can be made without it being reckoned in with others.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The president spoke of the appeals of downtrodden nations, that America first of all seems to be appealed to these.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There is no nation in Europe that suspects the motives of the United States.&rdquo; He said.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;While nations believe that men now have come into a different view they do not seem to resort to each other, but to the nation which has come to be known as the friend of mankind.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The president was cheered when he said: &ldquo;The confidence we have established throughout the world, imposes a burden upon us. Any man who opposes the tide will find himself thrown upon barren ground.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;If America were now to fail the world, what would become of it? America is the hope of the world and if she does not justify that hope the results will be unthinkable.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;We set this nation to make men free, and now we will make men free.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The president said he was ready to fight for this.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>TEXT OF HIS ADDRESS</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The president&rsquo;s speech follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I wonder if you are half as glad to see me as I am to see you. It warms my heart to see a great body of my fellow citizen again because in some respects, during the recent months I have been very lonely, indeed, without your comradeship and counsel, and I tried at every step of the work which fell to me to recall what I was sure would be your consul, with regard to the great matters which are under consideration.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I do not want you to think that I have not been appreciate of the extraordinary generous reception which was given to me on the other side, in saying that it makes me very happy to get home again. I do not mean to say that I was not very deeply touched by the cries that came from the great crowds on the other side. But I want to say to you in all honesty that I felt them to be a call of greeting to you rather than to me.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I did not feel that the greeting was personal. I had in my heart the overcrowing pride of being your representative, and of receiving the plaudits of men everywhere, who felt that your hearts beat with theirs in the cause of liberty. There was no mistaking the tone in the voices of those great crowds. It was not a tone of mere greeting. It was not a tone of mere generous welcome; it was the calling of comrade to comrade, the cry that comes from men who say: &lsquo;we have waited for this day when the friends of liberty should come across the sea and shake hands with us, to see that a new world was constructed upon a new basis and foundation of justice and right.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>America Trusted.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the inspiration that come out of those simple voices in the crown, and the proudest thing I have to report to you is that his great country of ours is trusted throughout the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have not come to report the proceedings or the results of the proceedings of the peace conference. That would be premature. I can say that I have received very happy impressions from this conference; the impression that while there are many difference of judgment, while there are some divergences of object, there is, nevertheless, a common spirit and a common realization of the necessity of setting up new standards of right in the world. Because the men who are in conference realize as keenly as any American can realize that they are not the masters of their people; that they are the servants of their people and that the spirit of their people has awakened to a new purpose and new conception of their power to realize that purpose and that no man dare go home from that conference and report anything less noble than was expected of it.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>Small Nations Affected.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The conference seems to you to go slowly; from day to day in Paris it seems to go slowly, but I wonder if you realize the complexity of the task which it has undertaken. It seems as if the settlements of this war affect and affect directly, every great, and I sometimes thing every small nation in the world, and no one decision can be made which is not properly linked in with the great series of other decisions which must accompany it, and it must be reckoned on with the final result, if the real quality and character of that result is to be properly judged.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;What we are doing is to hear the whole case; hear it from the mouths of the men most interested; hear it from those who are officially commissioned to state it; hear the rival claims; hear the claims that affect new nationalities, that affect new areas of the world, that affect commercial and economic connections that have been established by the great world war through which we have gone. And I have been struck by the moderateness of those who have represented national claims. I can testify that I believe nowhere have I seen the gleam of passion.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have seen earnestness, I have seen tears come to the eyes of men who plead for downtrodden peoples whom they were privileged to speak for; but they were not the tears of anger, they were the tears of ardent hope.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>America Their Hope.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how any man can fail to have been subdued by these pleas, subdued to this feeling that he was not there to assert an individual judgment on his own, but to try to assist the cause of humanity. And in the midst of it all every interest seeks out, first of all, when it reaches Paris, the representatives of the United States. Why? Because, and I think I am stating the most wonderful fact in history, because there is no nation in Europe that suspects the motives of the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Was there ever so wonderful a thing seen before? Was there ever so moving a thing? Was there ever any fact that so bound the nation that had won that esteem forever to deserve it?
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I would not have you understand that the great men who represent the other nations there in conference are disesteemed by those who know them. Quite the contrary. But you understand that the nations of Europe have again and again clashed with one another in competitive interests. It is impossible for men to forget theses sharp issues that were drawn between them in times past. It is impossible for men to believe that all ambitions have all of a sudden been foregone.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;They remember territory that was coveted; they remember rights that it attempted to extort; they remember political ambitions which it has attempted to realize &mdash; and while they believe that men have come into a different temper, they can not forget these things and so they do not resort to one another for a dispassionate view of the matters in controversy. They first resort to that nation which has won the enviable distinction of being regarded as the friend of mankind.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Whenever it is desired to send a small force of soldiers to occupy a piece of territory where it is thought nobody else will be welcome, they ask for American soldiers. And where other soldiers would be looked upon with suspicion and perhaps met with resistance, the American soldiers are welcomed with acclaim.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>American Soldiers Praised.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have had so many grounds for pride on the other side of the water that I am very thankful that they are not grounds for personal pride, but for national pride. If they were grounds for personal pride, I&rsquo;d be the most stuck up man in the world. And it has been an indefinite pleasure to me to see those gallant soldiers of ours.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Everybody praises the American soldier with the feeling that in praising him he is subtracting from the credit of no one else.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have been searching for the fundamental fact that converted Europe to believe in us. Before this war Europe did not believe in us as she does now. She did not believe in us throughout the first three years of the war. She seems really to have believed that we were holding off because we thought we could make more by staying out than by going in.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;And all of a sudden, in a short 18 months, the whole story is reversed. There can be but on explanation for it. They saw what we did &mdash; what, without making a single claim, we put all our men and all our means at the disposal of those who were fighting for their homes, in the first instance, but for a cause &mdash; the cause of human right and justice &mdash; and that we went in, not to support their national claims, but to support the great cause which they held in common.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;And when they saw that America not only held ideals, but acted ideals, they were converted to America and became firm partisans of those ideals.
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>War Won by Ideals.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I met a group of scholars when I was in Paris. Some gentlemen from on of the Greek universities who had come to see me and in whose presence, or rather in the presence of whose traditions of learning, I felt very young indeed. And I told them that I had had one of the delightful revenges that sometimes comes to a man. All my life I have heard men speak with a sort of condescension of idealists and particularly of those separate, encloistered persons whom they choose to term academic, who were in the habit of uttering ideals on the fee atmosphere when they clash with nobody in particular.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;And I have said I have this sweet revenge. Speaking with perfect frankness in the name of the United States, I have uttered as the objects of this great war, ideals and nothing but ideals, and the war has been won by that inspiration.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Men were fighting with tense muscle and lowered head until they came to realize those things, feeling they were fighting for their lives and their country, and when these accents of what it was all about reached them from America, they lifted their heads, they raised their eyes to heaven; then they saw men in khaki coming across the sea in the spirit of crusaders and they found that these men, reckless of danger, not only, but reckless because they seemed to see something that made that danger worth while.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Men have testified to me in Europe that men were possessed by something they could only call a religious fervor. They were not like any of the other soldiers. They had a vision, they had a dream and they were fighting in the dream, and fighting on the dream they turned the whole tide of battle and it never came back.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accepts Challenge.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;And now do you realize the confidence we have established throughout the world imposes a burden upon us. It is one of those burdens which any nation ought to be proud to carry. Any man who resists the present tides that run in the world will find himself thrown upon a shore so high and barren that it will seem as if he had be separated from his human kind forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I invite him to test the sentiments of the nation. We set this nation up to make them free and we did not confine our conception and purpose to America, and now we will make men free. If we did not do that all the fame of America would be gone and all her power would be dissipated. She would then have to keep her power for those narrow selfish provincial purposes which seem so dear in some minds that have no sweep beyond the nearest horizon. I should welcome no sweeter challenge than that.

				<b>SOME MEMORIES OF MAC-O-CHEE</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It seems a long shot from the shadows of today to the sunlight period of the past, when a Conestoga wagon, drawn by four horses garnished with bells, slowly jingled along in the early autumn, pulling not only the household furniture, but the family to Logan County. Those, to my memory, were golden hours. All day for four days, my mother, three sisters, my brother, and I, jolted on in a little springless wagon that was more fatiguing than the same time on foot. For three nights we found ourselves accepting hospitality from houses along the way, and the last night enroute we camped on the roadside, and that makes the most glorious memory of all. I recollect as vividly as if it were now, being awakened from a sound sleep by my mother as the day began to dawn above, the woods all about us were alive with the songs of birds, the drumming of pheasants, as they were called, the cawing of crows, the shrieks of multitudinous jays, while the queer call of the wild turkey could be heard at intervals. But the grandest event of all was three deer across the road. There was a startling crash in the underbrush near us, and, like a flash, a noble buck seemed to fly over the road followed by two does. They disappeared in the woods again and the sight deprived me of breath for an instant. There is no exaggeration in this. There are men yet alive who can bear testimony to the abundance of game at that time in the part of Ohio. Humanity loves to kill. The brutal instinct in us is so strong that no culture weakens, let alone destroys the propensity. The horrible inhumanity that killed our Savior cannot be expected to spare the innocent little birds and helpless animals that once adorned our fields and woods. These same fields and woods are now as silent as the Streets of Urbana. I sometimes think it odd that we butchers of birds and beasts are not sometimes startled and made afraid by the grave suggestion that there is a class of beings above and about us cruelly savage and destructive as we are to the animated creation beneath us. These unseen things may not be any more devils than we are, and may look upon our vindictive mutilation and destruction with the same lofty indifference that marks our superiority to the dependent and helpless.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;However, it is a reminiscence, and not a moral essay that you ask of me.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;On the fifth day we reached our new home in the wilderness. It was a double log cabin and yet remains, somewhat disfigured from its original appearance, four mouldy old shingles take the place of clapboards for a roof, and the logs are concealed by weatherboarding on the outside, and plaster and paper within, It is a picturesque old house today with its front porch holding, on posts cut from the woods with bark upon them, a quaint room above, and the dormer windows tell of a half story all punctuated by brick chimneys built on the outside. When I first saw it, and from many years after, the space between the two ends was open and the logs filled between by chunks of wood well plastered with mortar. At all seasons we children fell asleep with the stars twinkling upon us through the chinks of the clapboard roof and many a time we awakened in the winter with a thin sheet of snow upon our bedclothes that had drifted in through the crevices between the logs. It was home all the same &mdash; dear, sacred home, made precious by loving tenderness and refined culture. In that log cabin could be heard, with its thin tinky notes, the first piano brought to the West across the Alleghany mountains, and it was the pioneer of millions that have since tortured the ears of the truly musical. At the head of that household was a grand man and a sainted mother; but I cannot trust myself to write of those pioneers, nor is it fit that I should.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Talk of you evolution, out of those hardy, honest, kindhearted pioneers, not only of that log cabin but the hundreds that make up the settlements, came the mean, selfish, sordid, money-getters of today. Do not wax wroth over that, I include myself. What a life! Not exactly of charity, but of noble, generous emotions existed at the time. We loved our neighbors, and our neighbors loved us. When a log cabin was to be erected, all turned out, amid cheering laughter, to roll up the rough structure. When sickness came &mdash; which it frequently did from privation and exposure, the country side was filled with nurses and helpers. A death made the neighborhood one family of mourners. As Governor Tom Corwin said to me, &ldquo;The spirit of Christ marched with the pioneers.&rsquo; They carried to the border a feeling of helpfulness never know to other communities. It was true religion; the religion of love. It was rough, however, and here followed an illustration I wish to put to print, but it is too rough for type. Many a time since hearing it I have set the table in a roar. Governor Corwin told of how one sonny Sunday afternoon he made one of a Baptist congregation assembled under the trees in Kentucky for divine service. As there were no newspapers in those days on the border, the minister was used as an advertising medium, and ere he opened services read from the pulpit or stand certain notices referring to the business of the neighborhood. On this occasion the Rev. Mr. Tubbs began with a request fro prayers from the congregation in behalf of Bro. Buck Nailor, an inestimable citizen who had been knocked in the head while resisting an officer.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;See him damned first,&rdquo; responded a voice from the meeting, which as sustained by an eruption of solemn amens.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The next notice I omit for reasons stated above. It referred to a possible improvement of the breed of horses from brother Smith&rsquo;s thoroughbred Arabian.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The third notice created quite a disturbance and led to an intermission of divine service of an hour for a fight. The preacher called attention of the brethren to the fact that Brother Tomkins had some fine powder ready for sale. The pioneers made their own powder, and the advertising divine suggested that probably some brother could bear testimony to its value. At this, a tall, slab-sided, broad-shouldered, double-fisted son of the Baptist persuasion arose and roared:
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Brother Tubbs, it ain&rsquo;t worth a tinker&rsquo;s dam &mdash; I&rsquo;ve tried it,&rsquo; and here followed a description of that power that cannot be reproduced in a filmy journal, or indeed anywhere else, save late after a dinner of gentlemen. The account of the powder had scarcely ended ere that irate powder merchant collided with the tall member and a terrific fight followed, in which nearly all the male members of the little congregation of the Lord took part on one side or the other. At the end of an hour divine services were resume as if nothing had occurred.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Dear old master of human emotions, who could sway a crowd at will from tears to laughter and from laughter to tears, who &mdash; take him all in all &mdash; was the greatest man Ohio ever put to the front, and yet in passing from history in a way to make those grieve who loved and reverence him in life. The memory of his genius claims is not for him. His ears have long been closed in death and his brave, pure, beautiful spirit has passed into eternity that swallows the myriads of men and worlds without end. History is after all but a brief flash that reveals like lightning for but an instant the things that are not what they seem. It is not for us and our children to cherish his fame as a noble heritage for others to emulate, worship and live by. His marble statue, executed by our Quincy Ward ought to grace the old Hall of the House at Washington, D.C., where the walls so often echoed to his musical voice in its eloquent utterance.

				&ldquo;It is Tom Corwin who, leaning back in the huge arm chair upon the porch of the old homestead at Mac-o-chee, said, as he gazed upon the willow-fringed meadows; &lsquo;Of all the places this is the easiest to live and die in I ever saw.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;To my memory the country seems to have been as well filled with quaint, odd characters as it was with game. Nearly every man seemed to have been turned out of a peculiar mod, and shaped his life by an eccentricity of his own creating. I remember one, a mason, known by the name of &lsquo;old Gettysburg&rsquo; from the fact that he began all his stories, mostly monstrous lies, with &lsquo;when I was in Gettysburg.&rsquo; We boys fairly doted on old G. He could discount Munchausen and not try.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Now byes so yer off-eye on me,&rsquo; he would say, for example, filling his stubby clay pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&rsquo;goin to tell ye about a big Gun. It was a gun left over from the Revolution; a prime favorite of Gineral Washington&rsquo;s. It laid alongside the road goin&rsquo; to Gettysburg. Well, one night I was a ridin&rsquo; on hoss-back sorter belated, and a storm came up. It was a big storm I tell ye. The lightning flashed right along bright enough to blind ye, while the thunderbolts just dropped about promiscuous-like, knocking right and left, and the rain &mdash; well it jist came down in sheets. I suddenly recollected that cannon, and to git out of the storm I jist rode my horse into it at the muzzle. I was about comfortin&rsquo; myself when the stage coach came a thunderin&rsquo; down. The fooled driver missed his way and drove heltersplit into that cannon and killed his two leaders dead at the britch.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;And what became of you?&rsquo; chorused the boys.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Well, I though just a quick as a wink what I&rsquo;d got to do, and I leaped my hoss out at the touch-hole.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Another favorite monstrosity he was fond of telling came up in illustration of his agility. The powder mills of Gettysburg caught fire. There was danger of an explosion that would destroy the town. He was at work topping a chimney a mile off. He immediately, with great presence of mind, dropped his shoes, descended the ladder and ran that mile. He got into the mills and tramped out fifty-eight barrels of powder in his stocking feet, and so save the town.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s interlocutory words became to be proverbial. When one began a fish story, or any other boastful narrative, he would be interrupted by a cry from some one, &lsquo;when I was at Gettysburg&rsquo; and effectually silenced.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The man, however, that to this day holds the affection born in my boyish heart was George Martin. He was what my father called a first-class chickencoop carpenter, and evidently by the day and not by the &lsquo;job.&rdquo; He was so slow not only in his work but in all things. The time he took to eat was exasperating. He was longer in getting to sleep and certainly in waking than any man alive. His gait, as he moved, was as if his limbs were lazily consulting each other as to long premeditated motions, while the sentences that escaped his everlasting masticated tobacco seemed to lounge our of his mouth.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;There was enmity between George Martin and one Mike O&rsquo;Brien. This grew out of a theological difference. I never could discover that either had any religion, but Mike was a stout Catholic to his finger tips, or rather to the tip of his shillalah. Martin had read but one book and that was Fox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Martyrs,&rdquo; fearfully illustrated, hence Martin regarded all Catholics more or less sons of Satan, and O&rsquo;Brien was especially marked out for damnation. This he leped out by damning O&rsquo;Brien on all occasions.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;O&rsquo;Brien was not slow in reciprocating, and we were frequently favored with conversations that were not supposed to be of a religious nature, but so hid under profanity that the theological instinct was somewhat obscured, and especially was this the condition when the disputed ended in a fight &mdash; no unusual occurrence.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;One Saturday evening a number were engage near the saw mill shooting at a mark. Martin had put down his loaded rifle to look at the mark and chalk the latest shot. While thus engaged O&rsquo;Brien came along quite drunk. It was growing dark and had it been broad daylight, White&rsquo;s Best, of which he had been partaking, would have obscured his vision. As it was he quite astonished Martin.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Gimme a goon,&rdquo; cried Mike and before he could be arrested cocked and leveled the rifle. Poor Martin was bending over scrutinizing the holes lately made in the board, and thus presented a bright patch on the seat of his pantaloons, that Mike mistook for the mark, aimed at and fired. Had he aimed at anything else than Martin he might have hit the great hunter and theological student of Fox. As it was, Martin heard the crack of the rifle and at the same instant the shrill whiz of the bullet. He left that locality immediately. He did not wait to pass any whereases or result ions. He could have given Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s guests a lesson as he retired beyond range.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;Look at the dirty baste runnin&rsquo; away wid de mark,&rsquo; cried O&rsquo;Brien. Nothing could convince Martin that this was not a premeditated attempt on his life, instigated by the Pope of Rome.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Martin, according to his own account, was a mighty hunter. He had scarcely been sent on end from his trough of cradle before he began killin &lsquo;injuns.&rsquo; His stories of deer stalking and bear killing made our unkempt locks stand on end. He was a great man in our youthful eyes and minds, and with the lofty ambition to be hunters, the writer of this, aged ten and his younger brother, aged six, wended our way to Martin&rsquo;s cabin and informed the mighty hunter that father had sent us to borrow his rifle, pouch and powder horn, as he wished to kill a hog. The unsuspecting master of first-class chicken-coops handed over the rifle, pouch and horn. We were scarcely out of the cabin before we made for the woods and hid the precious weapon in a hollow log. The next morning at daylight we were on the hunt. The discovery, however, was soon made that killing game called for something besides arms. We banged away at all in sight without bringing anything down, even a chipmunk. This was simply disgusting. We caught glances of deer, we stumbled on wild turkeys, we saw the track of a bear &mdash; at least we took it to be such &mdash; it might have been that of a big dog, but never trophy came our way.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This was mortifying in the extreme. We had slaughtered nothing, and while mournfully recognizing this fact, old man Burnside&rsquo;s huge boar came to our vision. He was an immense animal made up mainly of skin, bone and bristles. Saw-back and long-snouted, he was calmly munching acorns, when we unanimously voted him a wild boar. Martin had told us what terrible beasts they were, so we dropped behind a fallen tree, and I brought the trusty rifle to bear, determined to rid the woods of this enemy of man. It took some time to get a bead on the beast that came moving toward us all unconscious of the peril impending. At last I touched the hair trigger and the gun went off, and so did we. The haste was uncalled for. The philosophical old father of gods looked up from under his huge ears with sagacious, but not attractive eyes when the whip-like report of the rifle rang out, and then went on with his dinner, evidently impressed with the belief that this noise had nothing to do with his pursuit &mdash; suddenly, however, he gave a loud squeal and came toward us. My heart beat like a trip-hammer and seemed to be striving to get out at my mouth. The beast surged past us and disappeared through the brush. Old farmer Burnside said afterward, in profound ignorance of what had been done to his paternal hog, &lsquo;that ere animal kem home a squealing&rsquo; an&rsquo; then wen cavortin&rsquo; round a hull day&rsquo;s if he felt sorter ridiculous, then he sorter pined down and died.&rsquo; Of course we never enlightened the old man as to that sporadic case of hog cholera.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Descending from our perches, we hastily proceeded to reload the rifle, as I suggested the wild boar might return. In our haste to secure a change of venue we left, unawares, the ramrod in the barrel.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was late in the afternoon after the active operation in prot that we sat under a log despondent and desperately hungry. We left home with half a loaf of bread and a little salt, intending to feed upon what we killed. Half a loaf, shared by two boys of such healthy appetites, only made us the more hungry. We were about to drop the hunting business and steal ingloriously home, when a strange noise on the other side of the log attracted our attention. Rising up we peered over and saw a magnificent flock of wild turkeys grouped about and feeding on the crumbs of bread we had dropped. Fortunately for us the foliage of the lately fallen tree hid our heads as I brought the gun to bear and banged. The flock scattered, leaving two dead and one wounded, thanks to the ramrod that had evidently swung through like a chain-shot. Dropping the rifle, we gave chase to a wounded turkey that could not fly, but made excellent time with its legs. How it fluttered along, and how we followed it is vividly remembered by me today. At times we ere nearly upon it, and then it would make a spurt and almost leave us. At last it stuck between two saplings, and ere it could extricate itself, we tumbled bodily upon the bird. Decapitation with an old Barlow pocket knife was immediate, and then dragging the dead specimen along, we were nearly exhausted, we attempted to return to the gun and slaughtered game. After probably an hours work &mdash; it seemed like five to us &mdash; we found ourselves lost, or rather the gun and turkeys lost. Then we made an effort to return and, dropping our turkey, for it was to heavy to carry, we hurried off. Some time after, just as the last rays of the sun were lifted from the tree-tops, we came upon something lying on the ground and, on closer examination found it to be our dead turkey. We were lost in the trackless forest, and in our effort to escape had made a complete circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;In the desperate time that followed, night fell upon us. It may seem a light affair to others, but to us boys the situation was simply terrifying. Old Martin and others had filled our credulous minds with wild stories of bears, boards, &lsquo;painter,&rsquo; and not only this but ghost stories of headless horsemen that galloped through the woods. We sat exhausted at the foot of a tree, and I confess that I wept copiously, which weeping was garnished by individual howls. My younger brother wept also, but in a more quiet manner. In the midst of this he said:
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;&rsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of bellerin&rsquo; &mdash; let&rsquo;s climb a tree like Martin did the night the ten thousand wolves got after him, then bears and things can&rsquo;t hurt us.&rsquo; We acted on the suggestion. I had observed an old tree that, in being uprooted by a storm, had lodged in falling upon other. We could yet in the gloaming see this refuge, and up the nearly prostrate trunk we climbed till we reached the point where the fork of the bent tree held its dead enemy, and there among the crushed limbs were found a rather comfortable nest. We acquired some little courage in this refuge, but towns-folk and those unacquainted with forests, and suppose that after dark theses woods are silent, had better pass, even now, a night among them. They will learn that it is a night, more than in daylight the forests are alive. All sorts of unseen things come out for a little exercise in the air. The great throngs of game it is true have disappeared, but coons, mink and &lsquo;possums emerge from their hiding places in search of food, and have a cheerful intercourse of a gossipy, and more or less belligerent nature. Great horned owls hoot at each other&rsquo;s chestnuts, and laugh immoderately at their own. One hears at intervals the stealthy tread, or rather shuffling movement among leaves that ceases as mysteriously as it began. At the time of our terrified night sojourn, these sounds were multiplied and of an uglier nature. There were cries of animals, piercing and fearful. But waried nature came to our relief and we fell asleep to awaken in the broad daylight, stiff and sore from the cramped position the tree afforded us. Crawling down, we moved from the rising sun and ere long found a road that was familiar to us. While tramping on, we heard horns blown at regular intervals to the right and left of us. Directly a man on horseback appeared along the road armed with a tin horn that he would toot every few minutes. In this tooter we recognized George Martin. &lsquo;Sakes alive, you little minks, where o earth have you been?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the hull country up a searchin&rsquo; and blowin&rsquo; horns, and your mother night about dead wit the scarre.&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;He gave two short notes form his horn and in a few minutes a crowd had gathered, among it my father. He tried to look sever and scold us, but the delight felt at finding us safe, dissipated his wrath. Our dear mother passed from fear to pride at our adventure. George Martin lost his gun, but as my father had to purchase him another, this was not so bad, as the fact soon developed that I could match my master in recounting wild adventures.
			</p>
			<p>
				This day and night gave us foundation enough for stories that simply disgusted and silenced old George. What bear I killed, what bears I shot, while even Indians in war paint were put to flight. As for the headless horsemen that galloped by at midnight, they not only grew in number at every narration, but were pursued by headless hounds and hoop snakes without number. I never could get my brother to endorse any of these delightful romances, but as I was much bigger and quite able to punch his head he prudently abstained from comment or contradiction.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;It was George Martin&rsquo;s private opinion publicly expressed that&rsquo; all boys are born liars.&rdquo; He did not know, of course, how that imaginative faculty, properly trained and chastened down, makes the successful journalist, especially when he works up an interview or writes a political platform.

				<b>The sketch, &ldquo;Memories of the Mac-o-chee</b>,&rdquo; we publish today is a choice specimen of work of the well known author and journalist who kindly contributes it for the Christmas Citizen. It sparkles with a quaint humor, for which he is know the world over, and has in addition a tenderness in which he seldom indulges in print. This reminds us that Col. Donn Piatt is in one respect a very singular man. He is not only two sided, but his two sides are antagonistic to each other. While know to the world as a casuistic cynical and sometimes savage wielder of a remarkable pen, in private life to those who know him personally he is amiable in manner, kind-hearted, generous, and impulsive &mdash; much to his own injury. He has lived all his life among us, and is not only known as a man of deeply religious nature, but the care and tenderness he has shown an invalid wife for twenty years has won him not only love but admiration.

				<b>RECOLLECTIONS OF LONG AGO.</b>
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				<b>URBANA, DECEMBER 23, 1889</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Editor Citizen: &mdash; When you requested me to furnish you a paper on Christmas in old-time Urbana, I readily agreed, thinking it would be an easy task to recall incidents enough to fill a column or two; and it would, though I discover, as I begin the work, that my memory recalls occurrences too personal to myself or near relatives to be suitable for a newspaper, being nearly all associated with home &mdash; either my father&rsquo;s or my own. I &mdash; all of us &mdash; remember Christmas as the happiest of holidays, for it is then we view one with another in efforts to promote the happiness of others, perhaps with some selfishness, thinking only of those who are dear to us, and neglecting those whose barren, isolated lives call for sympathy and help, or failing to &ldquo;feed the hungry and clothe the naked.&rdquo; But while there may be this tinge of selfishness in our observance of the day, I believe the great majority of Urbana people possess the true spirit of benevolence and good will, and if they are in any sense neglectful are thoughtless rather than inwardly selfish. This must be so, for when did a real charity fail of prompt response from our people? From my earliest recollection Urbanians have been liberal, and have given of their goodly stores to the needy, and generally their charity has been given other than at home, for it is worthy of note that we have had little poverty and suffering in our midst. We have escaped great calamities by fire, water and famine, and have been steadily self-reliant and prosperous. And then we have had a moral community, with well sustained and well attended churches and exceptionally good schools and here people of refinement have found opportunity to make home-like homes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Christmas in old-time Urbana was a general but not a public holiday, unless we include the whole Christmas week, during which it was the custom away back in the &ldquo;fifties&rdquo; to make merry in public entertainments such as fairs and balls, usually for the benefit of some organization, notably the fire companies, which in those days were the pride of our people and next to the churches nearest their hearts. Every able-bodied young man who sought the smiles of fair lady or the approval of solid men of property was expected to be enrolled a member of a fire company, and the rivalry between the different companies for first place in the people&rsquo;s affections was sometimes a little more than healthy. For a number of years the fire ladies &ldquo;took the town,&rdquo; and their exploits and achievements were every pleasing subjects for conversation in parlor, store, or shop; and the spirit of the firemen must have crept into even the church for it is true that Rev. Granville Moody, pastor of the First M.E. church, was a ready and fearless actor at a fire. About 1858, on Sunday evening, a house on Locust street, near Granson&rsquo;s old livery stable, was burning and the fire bell was rung. When the first tap of the bell sounded, Mr. Moody was in the midst of a prayer. Before the second tap he was half-way down the pulpit steps and saying &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; as he ran, he rushed from the church and to the fire and was the first man on the burning building, working vigorously and intelligently until the flames were conquered. I have heard, too, that the fire companies got into politics, and that one of our citizens who was a candidate for an important State offices was defeated through the efforts of a fellow townsman(who leaned toward the &ldquo;other company,&rdquo;) who derisively referred to him as wearing a &ldquo;monkey jacket&rdquo; and &ldquo;running with the boys.&rdquo; A friend of the candidate, knowing his ability and true worth, tried hard to overcome the effect of all the enemy&rsquo;s ridicule, but without avail; the money jacket was too much for the Cincinnati delegation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long ago, too long ago for me to know anything about it, the then young fellows of the village organized a fire company and ran with a machine called Champaign. Early in the &lsquo;50&rsquo;s the young men began to refer to the Champaign as a <i>tub, and </i>the men who managed it as <i>old fogies, </i> and a demand was made for a modern engine, and young, active men to fight fire. Talk ripened into action, and the Molunkee fire company was organized, and a new side-stroke engine procured. This was the beginning of the firemen&rsquo;s era in Urbana, and later followed the organization of the Young Americas, the natural successors to the Champaign.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Molunkee company included in its membership nearly all of the &ldquo;high-toned&rdquo; young men and many of the more substantial citizens of the village. I was but a lad then, too young to be admitted to membership, and as I watched the men on parade, wearing their black pants, blue blouses, red belts, red neck-ties and firemen&rsquo;s caps there grew in me a determination to be one of their number as soon as years should make me eligible. But the changes of years changed my purposes, though I have never entirely recovered from my admiration of that body of men. There was a time when I could recall the name of every member of the company, I think, and can now name a large percentage of them. It might be of interest to your readers to see a list of their names, and but for the fact that you have just telephoned me for &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; I would give it from a roll which I suppose could be procured. In the hurry I will mention from memory the following:
			</p>
			<p>
				*J.V. Guthrie, &ldquo;Joseph H. White, C. H. Ward, *Lee R. Taylor, Aaron Wiley, *C. W. L. Taylor, William Wiley, *William Chatfield, *David Chatfield, *Henry McComsey, John R. Lemen, George Cruzen, N. A. Wierman, A.C. Deul, T. T. Brand, *W. V. Colwell, C. W. Miller, *W. A. Brand, *Ross Colwell, C. F. Colwell, J. C. Brand, Jr., *Horace G. Happersett, William R. Patrick, *William M. (Tip) Patrick, Isaac B. Happersett, *Charles W. Humphreys, William Warren, Henry Rhodes, John T. Zombro, *Saunders Hubbell, William Fairchild, *John M. Cundiff, C. W. Roof, *Evan G. Wiley, Joseph C. Vance, James Kidder, *Robert Outram, Robert Sanders, *L. L. Marsh, T. G. Keller, Joseph Keller, Henry McDargh, John McDarr, *James H. Taylor, *James McDargh, W. A. McComsey, W. A. Sampson, John J. Anderson, John D. Rock, William Knight, Charles Rock, *Samuel H. Hamilton, *G W. Geiger, *Aden Wiley, *John Talbott, Archie Houston, Marcus Stansbury, Theo. Stansbury, William Ganson, *John Morrison, William S. Reynolds, B. F. Ganson.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our older citizens will recognize that every business interest as well as the highest social element of the village were directly or indirectly represented hence it is not surprising that when a Christmas week fair for the benefit of the Molunkees was announced it created universal interest and everybody made proper preparation to attend. I think our business men must have contributed liberally to this fair, for there were disposed of during the week many valuable articles by &ldquo;chance,&rdquo; and there was a general discussion of the propriety or wickedness of <i>lotteries.</i> This was perhaps the beginning, in Urbana, of the discussion of the right or wrong of &ldquo;fair lotteries,&rdquo; but the discussion did not result in a settlement of the question, nor do I think there has yet come to be one mind on the subject. Then as now there were people who believed the giving or taking of anything by chance was a species of gambling, others saw no harm in it, and yet others thought the object so worthy that they were willing to be oblivious to the little wrong for the great good. The fair was held in the old Union Hall; and during its continuance there was provided special entertainment for every evening, consisting of music, re citations and readings, and one of the features was an original song by C. H. Ward, who, by the way, is the only one of the original officers living. The song was considered a great &ldquo;hit,&rdquo; relating as it did the heroic deeds of the young
			</p>
			<p>
				firemen and ridiculing the efforts of the old fogies, all in a pointedly witty strain. I am sorry I can not remember the entire song, but can only recall the chorus:
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				Good-bye, good-bye, old Champaign,
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				Champaign, fare you well,
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				The Molunkees say you&rsquo;ve had your day,
			</p>
			<p class="text-center">
				And now they&rsquo;ll sound your knell.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was published during the week &ldquo;The Trumpet,&rdquo; edited by W. A. Brand and C. W. Miller, and in its columns were found not only a full representation of the business men, but good editorials bearing on fire companies and spicy contributions from several of the literary people of the village, among them Mrs. Max Fyffe Crawford, James B. Armstrong, and C. H. Ward.
			</p>
			<p>
				The &ldquo;firemen&rsquo;s era&rdquo; continued five or six years, or until interrupted by the war, and the spirit has been perpetuated by the Young Americas, who still maintain an organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are all proud of our present fired department, rejoicing in its efficiency. I have no doubt the enthusiasm of anti-war times has been a potent influence in bringing about the high <i>espirt de corps</i> of our modern department.
			</p>
			<p>
				I do not often refer to &ldquo;the good old times,&rdquo; believing in the present, with its increased comforts and facilities for business, and looking to the future for greater developments of knowledge of nature&rsquo;s powers, whereby life is to be made brighter and happier, yet I think in the old days the children and youth of our town were more appreciative of the good things of Christmas that are those of our day. Then they were not forgotten, but the preparation of presents was not all absorbing for six months before Christmas. They hung up their stockings and were happy over whatever Santa Claus brought, and I am sure that was never much &mdash; not enough for one child to cry over because another had more. Usually the stocking was well filled with candy and &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; and occasionally a book or a pair of mittens; sometimes a more important article of wearing apparel. They did not look forward to a Sunday-school Christmas tree, for that is modern here, nor was there a satiety of presents from father, mother, uncles, aunts, and cousins, and yet I believe they were happier, because contented with what they had.
			</p>
			<p>
				Christmas has always been associated with my work on the CITIZEN AND GAZETTE, and in closing, it may not be amiss to tell why. In 1870, I was a compositor on the paper, and on the Friday preceding Christmas, I ran out of &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; and the editor failed to respond to my call for more. Desiring to get in a full day&rsquo;s work I &ldquo;set up&rdquo; the well known rhyme beginning, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the night before Christmas,&rdquo; and followed with a few &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; of comments. When my brother, who was one of the editors, returned my &ldquo;proof&rdquo; to me he asked me where I got my copy. I told him &ldquo;out of the case.&rdquo; He immediately proposed to me to do his editorial work for him the following week, to give him an opportunity to take a contemplated trip. I consented reluctantly, thinking if I made a great blunder Mr. Saxton would discover it in time to prevent disaster. As I heard no complaint from either the editor or reader, I suppose I did nothing seriously wrong. That was the beginning, and &mdash; perhaps &mdash; this is the end of my work on the CITIZEN.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wishing you a &ldquo;merry Christmas,&rdquo; a prosperous future, and hoping for more of the vigorous work of the Young Men&rsquo;s Business Exchange in the building up of a new Urbana, I am
			</p>
